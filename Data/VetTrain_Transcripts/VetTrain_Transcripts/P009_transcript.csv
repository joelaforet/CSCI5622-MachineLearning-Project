IRR,0,1.85163,"Interviewer: Hi <NAME>, how are you today?"
IRR,1.85163,3.573941,"Veteran: Hi <NAME>  I'm good."
IRR,3.573941,17.467247,"Interviewer: Good, good, so there's a little bit of delay with the audio, so, um, I'm going to, if I speak a little slower than I normally would in an in-person interview, it's just becuse of the Zoom. "
IRR,19.036464,19.648841,"Veteran: Alright"
Q1,19.648841,46.057605,"Interviewer: Alright, so I want to welcome you for making it through the screening process to the interview, congratulations, also congratulations on earning your degree. I'm going to pretend that like you, you're post degree. Um, nuclear engineering isn't for sissys, so well done. I understand that your can set more than a two MR barrier with that degree, right? Ha ha ha."
BCV,46.057605,46.708256,"Veteran: Si, ha."
Q1,48.162651,66.68706,"Interviewer: Excellent, excellent, so the first thing I'm going to do is ask you what attracted you to the <NAME> company as a career, and to this job specifically? So, I'm going to make the assumption, I'm just like going to give you some side hints. Is it you've read a job posting and I want you to talk as if you've chosen a job. "
A1,68.447644,91.33524,"Veteran: Um, well the uh, the type of jobs that you guys offer, uh really uh, inspired me. Uh, you guys are making great strides in the nuclear industry. It's a technology that I'm interested in. Um, it's near, it's uh, it's in a location that I like. Uh, it's kind of strange talking about that, um."
Q2,92.445174,95.660154,"Interviewer: Oh, no, I have a nuclear isotopes here, wait a minute."
BCV,96.234257,97.420738,"Veteran: Charted nucleides?"
Q2,97.7652,105.305094,"Interviewer: I have, nuclear radiographic isotopes book, so you and I are friends. Ha ha ha ha ha ha."
Q2,107.257046,125.62836,"Interviewer: So, okay, okay, so basically, typically the first thing in an interview is going to ask about is what attracted you to the job. And then the next thing they're going to say is please explain your experience as it relates to our job and how you would be the best fit for this job."
A2,126.776567,164.284667,"Veteran: Alright, um, my time in the navy gave me a lot of experience for nuclear engineering, um, I was an electrical technician, uh, nuclear, for submaries. Um, I spent almost two years in school, uh. I went to the South Carolina, uh, normal enlisted school for all nuclear, uh, technicians. And then, I went to uh, New York to spend a year at an actual nuclear plant. Uh, the MARF prototype."
BCI,164.437761,165.241506,"Interviewer: Okay."
A2,165.241506,264.925422,"Veteran: Um, where was that? Um, it's a department of energy, uh, base. Uh, we had actual hands on, uh, operating experience, uh, with the electrical plant, um, the steam plant in the, uh, the reactor plant. Um, just, mostly, uh remote control of those different uh, uh. Yeah, remote control of those different uh, things, uh. We, we, uh, had a hands on, uh, qualification where we would uh, read books, uh, draw diagrams uh, trying to figure out how, uh, different components worked together, um, fluid system and electrical, uh, systems. And we would um, go to a um, an expert and um, basically prove our knowldge to them. Uh, we would be expected to know all the seperate points, limits, stuff like that. Um, and how it normally operates and if there's a procedure that we're supposed to know we would have to recite that procedure. Um, once I was done with that, I went to Hawaii, Pearl Harbor, uh, and immediately upon getting there my ship was in dry dock, uh, undergoing an overhaul I immediately, uh, signed up and went on a ride with a different ship, um."
BCI,264.982434,267.62331,"Interviewer: Oh, so you weren't happy with being in the yards? You we're ready to get out."
A2,267.62331,287.602114,"Veteran: No, that wasn't the problem. Um, so, we were, we were just at the start of the dry dock experience, which means that I wouldn't get any operating experience, so I was allowed to go to an operating ship to get some actual experience before, before they needed that experience basically."
BCI,287.870029,289.094784,"Interviewer: That's awesome."
A2,289.324425,290.12817,"Veteran: Right."
A2,290.664,410.996109,"Veteran: Um, so three months under way with them, um, that was my only deployment, because of dry dock. Uh, I, I was the new guy, so I didn't really know anything and wasn't really allowed to do anything, but uh, yeah I, I went under way for two or three months. I saw Japan and South Korea. That was pretty cool. Uh, and then, they sent me back. And uh, in dry dock, I worked with civilian personel, um, uh, coordinating shops. Setting up, uh, safety limits like uh tag outs, of uh, fluid and electrical systems I would designate boundries that would work basically. And, and for us to work also. Uh, so that was, that was my big job, but uh, uh, aside from maintenance, um, we stood watch. Uh, during watch, I would man the electrical panel mostly. Um, I would take communications and uh, deliver, uh, commands from the officer in charge. So, I was the big communications guy most, most of the time. Um, relaying information and in dry dock, we had uh, we had to do a lot of testing so, a lot of it was very specific uh, commands, uh, following procedures and stuff like that. Um, and then, um, yeah, when we were shut down, I operated the, I also operated the uh, the reactor shut down. I wasn't allowed to operate out of power becuase I was an electrican. The reactor technican, uh technicians would do that. They had a special thing for that.But I was allowed to do it, shut down. So, yeah."
Q3,411.149203,443.460162,"Interviewer: Oh, well that's great. So, um, when you're relaying your experience to the job posting. Sometimes there will be something very speific in the job posting. I'm going to pretend like it says manage EHS, which is um, enviornmental health and safety, which means as a vendor, and a nuclear, uh facility there would be a dosimetry program, yes? A dosimetry"
BCV,443.91138,444.283911,"Veteran: Yes."
Q3,444.39975,445.081917,"Interviewer: I can't speak"
Q3,445.289229,459.510397,"Interviewer: So, tell me how you manage dosimety, the dosimety program for your vendors, like, how did you make sure the vedors were wearing their badges? How did you record, you can make this up too, um."
BCV,459.536139,461.019666,"Veteran: You're saying like job experience for that?"
Q3,461.325855,477.056293,"Interviewer: Yes, yes, so if i'm, if I'm asking that if on one of our properties that you would wind up having to manage the dosimetry program. Um, do you have experience doing that? And, um, you know, how would, how would that acutally play out?"
A3,478.893424,518.833201,"Veteran: Okay, um, well in the Navy, we had a control point watch would uh, prevent anyone from entering controlled radiation areas. Uh, they would uh, have a log of all the uh, all the qualified personel that could enter. And, if you wanted to uh, enter that controlled area, they would uh, ask to enter and they would uh, verify their information and then you would assign ment an electronic dosimeter that would track their their, uh, their, "
BCI,519.064881,520.236149,"Interviewer: Exposure rates."
A3,520.429215,543.082314,"Veteran: yeah. Yeah, more uh, more precise I guess it would be, so you would have a long term record that they would verify that you're allowed to go in there based on their limits and they, you, they would assign you a electronic one to make sure that limit's not exceeded in the short term. Um, so. "
Q4,543.193024,553.871351,"Interviewer: Thank you. And then, just from my own knowledge, those current dosimeters, do they track? Um, do they geo-track? Do they know where the person is at all times, or is it just a passive recording?"
A4,554.407181,595.589544,"Veteran: Um, so we used uh, thermo - what was it? - TLDs. thermoluminescent dosimeters to track long term exposure. And then we used electronic pocket dosimeters, which just, if you had uh - what do they call it - um, if you had areas that like a higher up area, and a lower up area that with different, uh, radiation areas, you would have to put multiple on your body at different places, but for the most part, you would just have one on your belt. And yeah, they weren't geo-cached or anything like that becuase we were on a submarine, so. Couldn't really use satilliete, or anything like that. Um."
BCI,595.934006,598.039052,"Interviewer: Point taken, ha ha ha"
A4,598.039052,603.741814,"Veteran: It would be if you exceeded a certain rate, or if you exceeded a dose."
Q5,606.038229,645.077271,"Interviewer: Well thank you for explaining that to me. Now, obviously, you have experience working in teams. Here at Haskell, no one works alone. This is considered the best job of your life. So, you will not only have to put up with um, our HR people, but you have clients, you have vendors and then, you have designer, architects, and engineers. Tell me a little bit about how you, as a leader and a team member can work together with other folks to make sure that the goals that your team has set out are acheived? Especially if there's friction going on. What's you approach?"
A5,646.187205,697.588611,"Veteran: Um, for the most part, I would like to partition work between different team members based on what they do best. If people have trouble doing work themselves, I would, I would try to get them a mentor, or someone to work with them. Um, based on my knowledge of those people. um, yeah, I would try to, I would try to, um, make the work, um, try to coincide so that it's all done at the same time. And then, um, have some kind of process to test that work if needed if it's like programming or something. To bring all the information together, have someone, um, verify all the work and then, um, make sure that works."
IRR,698.621998,763.342607,"Interviewer: That makes sense, sounds like you're going to play to each person's strengths and then make sure that the process doesn't create fraction, I like that. So, typically with an interview process and um, and this would be, I used to be at the railroad and, um, now I'm here in construction, is that we find out what makes you want to work for us as a company that you've done your research and you know who we are. The other thing we look for is that you know where your skills align to the job, so you've been able to communicate to me, um where your skills align to job posting, and then we want to find out about your teamwork and leadership skills, so we're there, communicated your leadership and teamwork skills to me so at this point in the interview is where we transition and I invite you to ask me questions about our work work enviornment and about how best fits into your plans for your career."
IRR,765.026644,792.813257,"Veteran: Um, I guess most of my questions would be around, uh the work enviornment. Um, what kind of uh like office, or, uh, like hands on, ex, uh, work I would be doing in that position, um, and my uh, uh, my chances for promotion and uh, going into a advisory role, I guess? Um. "
IRR,793.961464,889.224384,"Interviewer: Those are good questions. You always want to find out about what your work enviornment is and that what your work progression can be. Um, so I personally don't think that that's a bad question to ask in where you promote to coming from becuase we're used to that in the military. You have some, let me say, old school people and you can judge that for yourselve when you're in an interview, that they don't care where you're going. They want to hire you for the position they are hiring for, but people like myself want people to promote and develop, so what I will tell you is that coming to a company like Haskell, we are a design, build firm. You are not only going to be, you might be in your suit coat in the morning, you might be in your field gear in the afternoon, or vice versa, yoiu might be in the home office, you can be in any one if our satillite offices, which are in Maylasia, the Phillipines, Mexico, California, Dallas, three locations on the East coast, so if your client is Fritolay and you're working out of Dallas, you'll probably work out of a satillite office even though you're home based out of California. And you might be on the job site, which means you're going to be in your safety gear and you're going to be doing client visitations. Or, you might be going to the client corporate office, which so at any one visit, you might have to go from a suit to your boots in the entire time you're there you kind of have to self-sufficent in that "
IRR,889.645393,896.611183,"Veteran: Sounds very good, I like variety. I like uh, going out. Uh, working with people and doing stuff."
IRR,897.185286,919.843241,"Interviewer: That's awesome, and I also like how I give you an example and you gave me a um, you know, feedback on why that fits for you, so that's something you're always going to want to do in your interview; context, reaction, and result. So, keep that in mind. I know this is supposed to be like one of those moments, but I got to be like chief, I got to throw in one of those coaching moments while we're doing this. "
IRR,920.302524,921.412457,"Veteran: Good."
Q6,921.565551,963.398565,"Interviewer: So, at the end of a typical interview, you'll be asked if you have anymore questions, we've already given you the question time at the very end, we give you one last pitch and this comes straight out of the HR rule book. Promise you, the way we are doing this, and the way I'm coaching you through this comes straight out of the SHRM interview manual for HR people - there's one, trust me - it is: tell me why you are the best person for this job. So, it's your last at the end of the interview to sell yourself to the panel or the person on why you're the best person for the job, so what's your elevator pitch?"
A6,964.164036,1006.150144,"Veteran: Um, I think that my biggest strength is that, I'm a nuclear technician already; I have a big understanding of all the sys- all the parallel systems as opposed to a focus, I, I have a big understanding of everything that goes on around the reactor. Um, the safety and health and all that stuff. Being on a submarine, I, I qualified on every single system on the submarine, so I know how pretty much, I, I, I, I can kind of put my feet in anyone's shoes and figure out what they need and how their stuff works "
IRR,1006.992163,1044.806451,"Interviewer: There you go, there you go. Now I want you to take one thing away from our conversation when you go for your real job interview and that is you are at a prestigious university. Your naval experience, plus your education employs you for this position, so remember to take that I have experience, but then I went and learned a whole bunch of stuff. I'm going to put that together and you're not going to get a better work ethic or knowledge base than me. You'll do that for me? "
IRR,1045.189187,1058.699758,"Veteran: Yeah, I was trying to figure out how to, how to fit it in, becuase I didn't know what to talk about with, with school. Like, I did a programming class, and that's about the interesting thing I've done so far."
IRR,1059.350409,1076.229054,"Interviewer: It's okay you finished your education. That's the hard part. Nobody needs to know if you took basket weaving or welding. They need to know if you got your education and that you've proven yourself not only in the work force, you've proven yourself in the academic world and that you have the best of both worlds going forward."
IRR,1077.185893,1079.290939,"Veteran: Alright, thank you for your time."
IRR,1079.750222,1087.039862,"Interviewer: No problem, thank you for your service and I hate to hear those dosimeters haven't changed in thirty years, but ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."
IRR,1087.137021,1088.897606,"Veteran: Uh, well I mean it's very behind."
IRR,1090.505096,1102.408176,"Interviewer: It's okay, it's okay, you, you've, you're doing great. You're going to do great on your interview. I know you are. Just read that job description and be really prepared to sell your skills. You've got this. "
