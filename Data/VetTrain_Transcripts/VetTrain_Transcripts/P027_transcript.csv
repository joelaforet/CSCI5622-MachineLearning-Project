Q1,12.2545,17.312,"Interviewer: So probably my first question would be, uh-"
Q1,17.7285,26.118,"Interviewer: -oh, right off the first line- uh, what experience do you have in soliciting and negotiating contracts?"
A1,27.6055,28.022,"Veteran: None."

Q2,46.4075,54.9755,"Interviewer: Yeah, um, do you have any experience with, uh, training and reviewing the works of-of-of your subordinates?"
BCV,55.273,58.6645,"Veteran: Yes, yes I do, um, do I need to go into detail about this?"
Q2,58.9025,65.2095,"Interviewer: Yes, yes. Please do. Treat this like you would a normal interview, other than that I'm probably very inept [laughter]."
A2,65.3285,73.3015,"Veteran: Ok, I just want to make sure how much experience you wanted. Uh, so yes, uh, in the Army I did, uh-"
A2,74.1345,79.311,"Veteran: -training, for those who were under me, at times, uh when I was specialist, I trained with privates-"
A2,80.382,82.2265,"Veteran: -and other specialists that I worked with."
A2,82.8215,87.8195,"Veteran: Especially when I worked at a, uh- and sergeants as well, when I did security."
A2,88.117,95.9115,"Veteran: At [inaudible]. It's basically a giant blimp. And, um, part of my job, when I-when we were switching out within our rotation-"
A2,96.2685,100.5525,"Veteran: -at the end of the deployment, was I had to train these people who were coming in, on how to do the job."
A2,100.9095,110.9055,"Veteran: And even those who were higher rank than me, still had to understand that I was the instructor, and at the time- even though they outrank me, I'm still the boss."
A2,111.917,117.6885,"Veteran: They need to follow my instructions. I still had to be respectful to them, but they had to listen to me."
A2,118.343,123.936,"Veteran: And um, same thing for those who were also in the [inaudible] as well, I had to train them."
A2,124.5905,130.7785,"Veteran: Then, ten years at Reynolds and Reynolds, working at inventory department, and part of my job was to train new people."
A2,131.195,137.6805,"Veteran: Uh, probably the biggest thing I did there was I trained a part time, high school girl who came in at 17 years old, first job-"
A2,138.5135,144.8205,"Veteran: I remember this, because I had one week to train her on how to do a full-timer's job, entire thing-"
A2,145.5345,150.2945,"Veteran: You know, I had 3 days to train her how to do this job, cause I was going on vacation for 2 weeks."
A2,150.6515,159.8145,"Veteran: And I got her trained up. She did it. She hated me for it, but she did it, and, uh-"
A2,160.469,168.0255,"Veteran: It led- it led to her, uh, recieveing awards in uh, uh praise for the hard work she did while I was off. "
Q3,169.2155,171.1195,"Interviewer: Cool. Well that leaves me-"
Q3,173.2615,181.294,"Interviewer: That leads me to another good, general question. Uh, obviously she hated you for it, so you've had-had some level of conflict at the office. How do you deal with resolving conflict? "
A3,182.603,189.386,"Veteran: Most of- most of everything can be solved with talking it out sometimes when everything can be a simple understanding. When I say she hated me, it wasn't like-"
A3,190.1595,198.9655,"Veteran: -she was angry at me, but here it is- her first job- and you have 3 days to learn how to do a full-timer's job. And you're only supposed to be there part time."
A3,200.2745,203.6065,"Veteran: It was not fair for her. But-"
A3,204.38,211.8175,"Veteran: Yeah. Most-most learn any conflict can be solved by finding out, usually by talking, cause simple misunderstanding, uhm-"
A3,212.472,216.042,"Veteran: -or, could be someone's just having a bad day, week, month."
A3,216.994,217.827,"Veteran: You're-"
A3,220.207,229.251,"Veteran: If you have to ask to go higher than that, then- which I find it rarely does- then, uh, supervisors, managers can be brought in as needed."
Q4,233.3565,235.6175,"Interviewer: Gosh, man, there is-"
Q4,239.0685,242.817,"Interviewer: [inaudible], pulling from your resume-"
Q4,245.078,252.456,"Interviewer: Uh, tell me about your experience as being a recruitment officer for uh, [inaudible] Veterinary Hospital. Uh, what are your- what were your day-to-day tasks, what were-"
Q4,253.527,256.5615,"Interviewer: -uh, things you did commonly during that job?"
A4,257.0375,264.951,"Veteran: So, normally, the job goes um- and this is before covid, during covid, and now-"
A4,265.3675,275.1255,"Veteran: -uh, trucks come in- UPS, Fedex, unload the trucks, sort them packages, open them, check the items, against the um, packing lists that are included-"
A4,275.78,281.3135,"Veteran: -fill out any paperwork that needs to be done, such as if they're missing paperwork, I need to find out where they go to-"
A4,281.968,283.634,"Veteran: -and deliver them to various parts of the hospital."
A4,285.419,293.987,"Veteran: Um, the other part of my job, is I go shopping for the hospital, so someone puts an order in for ground beef, ground turkey-"
A4,294.463,303.269,"Veteran: -um, medicine that we need to pick up from HEB, or St. Joseph- paper towels, cleaning supplies- I drive all over town to find these items."
A4,304.2805,307.7315,"Veteran: Um, that's the main part of my job."
A4,308.0885,312.9675,"Veteran: Um, during covid, when A&M was on lockdown, uh-"
A4,312.9675,322.428,"Veteran: -at the very start of it, my job for almost 3 months- and Monday through Friday, no joke, was shopping."
A4,322.7255,331.472,"Veteran: That was my sole focus, every day, to go out and find cleaning supplies, paper towels, clorox, hand wipes, sanitzier-"
A4,331.829,339.8615,"Veteran: -all day, almost every day, around Bryan-College Station area. That was my job, pretty much."
BCI,342.063,344.0265,"Interviewer: All of the things that are hard to find. "
A4,344.5025,354.201,"Veteran: Exactly, and we got to the point where i had to tell uh, supervisors and the higher ups at the vet hospital- the small and large animal-"
A4,354.558,361.579,"Veteran: -""you're out of your mind"", because they wanted a 12-pack of Bounty paper towels, that's it, just 12-pack."
A4,362.5905,367.767,"Veteran: And going, ""you're not getting this.""You're gonna have to take either a single roll, or you're gonna have to take this other brand""."
A4,368.5405,375.2045,"Veteran: Same thing for uh, the cleaning sprays they wanted. They only wanted certain ones, like you're gonna get what you're gonna get, because you can't be picky now."
Q5,376.93,381.571,"Interviewer: Alright, cool. Um, let's see, anything else that is good."
Q5,387.997,402.2175,"Interviewer: I don't have a lot more on this one, unfortunately. Uh, so normally, I close out interviews with two general questions, uh, first one being ""tell me about yourself"". What are your hobbies, what do you like to do, who- anything you think I'd be interested in knowing."
A5,403.229,415.3075,"Veteran: Right, well, uh, veteran, United States Army, um, I served almost 8 years. Did uh, 6 active duty, and less than 2 years, um, in re-reserves."

A5,424.3515,426.4935,"Veteran: -right now, I'm going to college, here at Sam Houston."
A5,427.505,433.9905,"Veteran: Going for a criminal justice degree, been working on it um, chipping away, takes- it's taken me about 10 years to-to get the degree."
A5,434.407,438.2745,"Veteran: Mainly because I've been working full time and going to school part time."
A5,440.4165,449.1035,"Veteran: Uh, as far as hobbies go, I don't really have much free time. I have a 2-year old that takes up all my time [laughs] at home."
A5,450.234,457.5525,"Veteran: And what little free time I have is- I maybe get like, an hour or 2 to read, play a videogame, or watch a movie with my wife."
A5,459.0995,464.5735,"Veteran: And also, right now, branching out into uh, making my own hot sauces. "
A5,467.013,474.8075,"Veteran: Growing some scorpions, jalap- or scorpions and ghost peppers, and experimenting with those and I was making different hot sauces I guess."
BCI,475.5215,476.652,"Interviewer:Cool. Very cool."
A5,477.0685,479.2105,"Veteran: Had some successes, had some failures."
IRR,480.5195,485.101,"Interviewer: Uh, and then usually the last question I have is, ""is there anything you'd like to know about this company""."
IRR,485.934,492.8955,"Veteran: [inaudible] I would ask, uh, such as, what would be- if it hasn't already been disclosed, uh, what the pay would be."
IRR,493.907,496.763,"Veteran: Hours, expectations, stuff like that."
IRR,497.953,501.2255,"Veteran: Uh, you know, did- would you expect me to work those, yes or no."
IRR,504.855,507.235,"Veteran: And, really, if I had any other-"
IRR,509.258,513.542,"Veteran: -questions I guess, it-it's something about the jobs list was too vague, but you read the job description-"
IRR,513.542,516.636,"Interviewer: Yeah, it's very vague."
IRR,516.993,519.1945,"Veteran: And I really don't know what to ask about that."
IRR,520.801,521.991,"Veteran: Um-"
IRR,522.2885,527.227,"Interviewer: Yeah, uh, I-I normally suggest, you know, just know something about the company, because interviews are two-way- "
IRR,527.6435,528.5955,"Veteran: Yes, yes."
IRR,528.8335,532.82,"Interviewer: -keeping you for the job, you're evaulating the company for ""is this a good fit for me""."
IRR,532.82,536.8065,"Veteran: Exactly. [inaudible] with how you're going to treat [inaudible] during the interview."
IRR,538.1155,544.839,"Veteran: Because I have had some where it's been, like I come in there and I already know as soon as I look at you, I'm not getting this."
IRR,546.743,556.144,"Interviewer: Yeah, I-I've had jobs, or interviews where I look at the- the kinda how the talking went during them, and I'm just like ""Wow, I know I don't wanna work here""."
IRR,556.7985,557.7505,"Veteran: Exactly."
IRR,558.2265,559.595,"Interviewer: It's going to be a grind."
IRR,560.4875,570.1265,"Interviewer: Alright, um, well I don't have much else, and I've actually got to get this survey done, for my meeting at 3. So, uh, thank you for your time, uh-"
IRR,570.3645,570.9595,"Veteran: Thank you."
IRR,570.9595,583.276,"Interviewer: Hope you have a good day, oh-oh actually I have one follow-up question, I do. Notice this. It has nothing to do with the interview, I'm just curious, like, everyone else that I've interviewed has been going to Texas A&M, but you're the one who hasn't. "
IRR,584.585,593.629,"Interviewer: Uh, was this like, an open thing that just anyone could apply to, or, uh, was the- this-this program that we're taking part of right now-"
IRR,593.9265,598.6865,"Veteran: Are-are you saying- are you asking about um, my co-asking about because my college, is that why? "
IRR,598.984,604.7555,"Veteran: Yeah yeah, you're not A&M, like everyone else, I'm pretty sure they got recruited within the A&M system."
