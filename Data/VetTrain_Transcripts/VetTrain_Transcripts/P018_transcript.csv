Q1,40.333647,45.051817,"Interviewer: Added to your experince that would have you uh, fill this job?"
A1,46.070941,53.859067,"Veteran: Well both uh, civilian and military, I've contributed to my, the overall experience of my civilian career, of-"
A1,54.51332,61.055848,"Veteran: And my education, uh, I've learned and developed the experience through uh- "
A1,62.47759,67.447395,"Veteran: Inventory management, uh, um- "
A1,70.039243,73.121781,"Veteran: Cross-departmental collaboration, uh, communication is key."
A1,73.801197,81.916449,"Veteran: In my military career and uh, leadership aspect is huge. Um, I'm ten years- eleven years uh, in the- in the Army National Guard."
A1,82.369393,91.981877,"Veteran: Uh, I've deployed a couple times, um, the-the pace is very quick., um, so I'm very well equipped uh, to manage multiple individuals."
A1,92.686457,102.575741,"Veteran: Uh, and so, I think that my experience and my education would blend well to whatever this uh, job entails."
Q2,104.173628,116.856068,"Interviewer: So um, given that you talked about managing people, um, uh, what would you think, what would you say is the most challenging thing with managing a group of people?"
A2,120.001514,132.01712,"Veteran: Every individual thinks that they're the only one that is-is affected- um, the key is to, to to ensure them that "
A2,134.218932,144.309524,"Veteran: Yet we're going to take care of you, uh, and military, it's the first thing we always, we always teach is to take care of your people. Make sure they're fed, make sure they're paid, make sure they have a place to sleep."
A2,145.12734,152.412194,"Veteran: Uh, y-you can translate that into the civilian world- you take care of your employees, don't make sure your company thrives."
A2,153.544555,164.4278,"Veteran: Um, and so that's, that's what I do now, uh, you know I supervise, uh, group- small group of people,um, and our productivity is great. Um, so- "
A2,166.289904,169.523423,"Veteran: Both aspects have [inaudible]."
Q3,171.171637,177.387039,"Interviewer: Cool, cool, very good, well can you uh, and you don't have to be like, totally specific, but can you -"
Q3,178.657799,179.953723,"Interviewer: Describe uh, an instance where you got a challenge or, say, two people that work for you disagreed in one of those, uh you know- as you - as you were saying, and, and how did you resolve that conflict?"
A3,189.943661,203.922025,"Veteran: Um, so one of- a recent situation that we had at my civilian career here, um, we have a- an item that was incorrectly brought into our system, and it happened months ago, and only now is caught."
A3,204.576278,217.069991,"Veteran: Um, and now management- senior management's involved, and there's quality issues, documentation, uh, it's a wide range of people invovled and everybody is, you know, quite upset that you know, a little mistake happened."
A3,218.252679,229.450468,"Veteran: Uh, and you know, one of the people who's suggesting all these different things, you know, what they can do if they spent a little time in our department , doesn't exactly get the whole picture."
A3,229.739849,231.048355,"Veteran: Um, because they only-"
A3,232.910459,243.164615,"Veteran: They only did this job for a little bit, before they decided they wanted to get someting else. And so now they want to interject their-their opinion, and ""yeah I'm right, and""- "
A3,244.372466,247.555658,"Veteran: -""and you know all of you- yall don't know what you're talking about."""
A3,249.342271,258.287921,"Veteran: Uh, it turns out the individual doesn't actually know the right thing, he just he was in the job for a little bit, he thinks he's a subject matter expert now."
A3,258.791193,275.210423,"Veteran: Um, and the job he now, currently occupies, is supposed to be a subject matter expert job. Um, so, trying to manage his expectation of what he thinks is- can happen, what actually can happen- "
A3,275.537549,282.960803,"Veteran: Uh, is not is-is quite a challenge. Um, especially when there's senior management involved."
A3,283.539565,293.202376,"Veteran: Um, and the people who are actually solving the problem are not senior management. You kinda have to manage their expectations respectfully."
Q4,294.838009,298.776107,"Interviewer: Ok, ok. Um, so um- "
Q4,301.556682,307.444958,"Interviewer: Did you a-a, did you get an action item from that- you said it was introduced a long time ago, and whatnot."
Q4,307.759503,316.906461,"Interviewer: If you had to, you know, right something up, say a-a, an SOP or something to make sure that doesn't happen in the- in the future, h-how would you do that?"
A4,318.038821,328.24265,"Veteran: Well, funny enough, the procedure is an SOP, it's a- there's an action item open, it's called a deviation, uh, deviation from standard operating procedure."
A4,328.934648,332.394639,"Veteran: Um, when one get's opened it's actually a pretty big deal."
A4,333.60249,342.132941,"Veteran: The bigger issue is that it made- it made its way from- from multiple departments and levels, not in- the mistake wasn't caught."
A4,342.623631,357.721774,"Veteran: Until the end use of the- of the product. So what it comes down to is, it's training, and adherance to your operating procedure. Um, and the big issue- another issue is that people don't actually always uh- "
A4,362.125399,372.882825,"Veteran: They're not really held accountable for their actions, um, you know they-they, a little you know, you know, slap on the wrist, and ""hey don't do it again"", um-"
A4,373.41126,386.055955,"Veteran: It's different, like in the military, you make a mistake, they can take your rank, they can take your pay, your leave, [inaudible], a whole host of issues. You can't really do that on a civilian side, so-"
A4,386.987007,388.13195,"Veteran: Trying to-"
A4,389.767582,401.51897,"Veteran: Reeducate, and discipline someone on the civilian side is a challenge. Um, what I would suggest is, that- that person either needs to be pulled aside- "
A4,404.186308,413.182285,"Veteran: With the actual subject matter experts, and- totally, completely closed off environment so that, you know, they're not just embarassed in front of everybody."
A4,413.735884,422.329243,"Veteran: um, and they need to be reeducated, that you don't know everything, and this is the way- this is the way we have to take care of it. Um- "
A4,423.00866,428.192355,"Veteran: And sometimes, that can even be- you know, the right way would be done by a support [inaudible]."
A4,429.991551,435.867245,"Veteran: Just because you're a manager or supervisor doesn't mean you have all the answers. And you have to be able-"
A4,437.389641,441.264831,"Veteran: To stand up to whoever's [inaudible] and ahead of you."
A4,442.233628,444.838058,"Veteran: And you take responsibility for what, what they did."
A4,445.379075,456.287483,"Veteran: Um, you know, we always teach in-in my unit, in the Army, know-know the job, the man above you, teach your job to the man below you. At any point in time, you have to step aside and you're gone."
A4,456.765591,460.124928,"Veteran: Someone can take over and perform your functions."
Q5,462.024777,469.674503,"Interviewer: Cool, so um, so for this, uh, job, you know we are going to implement um, a, you know- "
Q5,471.851152,473.537111,"Interviewer: a change control board."
Q5,474.820453,476.619649,"Interviewer: Ok, for our material mangement. "
Q5,477.953318,483.199922,"Interviewer: Uh, so in this uh, CCB, this change control board program, change control board- "
Q5,484.143556,489.629215,"Interviewer: I want, come askig you to start this change control board and program. "
Q5,490.484776,493.428914,"Interviewer: What are- what are the things you need from the company?"
A5,494.976474,509.74749,"Veteran: So, you're gonna need a writeup of the incident, you'll need all the information, material, or the uh, the action that was involved, you know, dates times, batch numbers with lot numbers, item numbers, um-"
A5,510.615634,522.643821,"Veteran: Everybody involved. Um, so this would actually be multiple departments, from the materials warehosue, uh, there's quality control who approved it, quality assurance who's supposed to double check quality control."
A5,523.05902,535.376588,"Veteran: Um, could be the end user if they actually got- got the product and used it incorrectly, or if it was expired, or damaged, and they didn't pay attention to it, um- "
A5,535.95535,553.230142,"Veteran: So everyone gets, is-is uh, is involved, and you open up a collaboration, discuss what happened, where the shortfalls were, how can we improve, and you close your deviation, or- or your control board."
Q6,557.545694,557.93573,"Interviewer: Um-"
Q6,559.69718,564.604076,"Interviewer: And when you do uh, what kind of information do you need when you're getting uh, your-your material in?"
Q6,565.245747,565.7616,"Interviewer: Ok."
Q6,566.264872,575.827029,"Interviewer: What kind of information do you need uh, you know, just- just high level. What kind of information do you need to-to know that, that you're getting a quality product?"
A6,577.03488,590.91259,"Veteran: Um, well each, uh, each manufacturer has a, has specifications that they create their product on, um, and your quality assurance department would vet those specifications and create an internal material specification."
A6,591.239716,601.808416,"Veteran: Um, because any point in time, the manufacturer could change their product, uh, change the design, change uh, screw, or a plastic that they use."
A6,602.009725,613.10686,"Veteran: So your internal material specification, um, bumps against the manufacturer specification, so you know you're getting the exact same product- it'll have the right batch number, the right material number."
A6,614.088239,620.416877,"Veteran: When you get it in, you record your material number, your batch number, your internal batch number. Uh, and -"
A6,620.794331,622.48029,"Veteran: And, material lot number that- that the manufacturer assigns. And then you use that batch number to track the product from reciept to consumption."
A6,637.867814,654.878389,"Veteran: And there's also s- certificates of quality, um, certificates of irradiation, uh, whatever the product is, uh, that the manufacturing ensures or guarantees the product that you're getting followed all the necessary manufacturing protocols."
Q7,656.363039,665.157708,"Interviewer: So what do you do when you get uh, a product, and that um, you know, obviously you well, measure it-"
Q7,666.579449,670.17784,"Interviewer: for whatever, and it's-it's outside what you believe the specs should be. "
Q7,671.335364,684.470749,"Interviewer: And you get with the manufacturer, manufacturer says ""no , that's-that's within our specs, it's-it's within the specs"" and you go like, meausure it again and you're like ""no, I don't think it's within your specs"". And- how do you arbitrate a situation like that?"
A7,685.238238,691.768184,"Veteran: Well uh, first thing I would do is get with our sales rep, whoever sold us the product."
A7,692.208547,702.462702,"Veteran: Um, most manufacturers are pretty good about uh, about double checking if you have a complaint, they know their number 1 priority is making sure the customer is satisfied so- "
A7,703.167282,714.163763,"Veteran: Um, a lot of times, our sales rep would send the product back to the manufacturer, you know, double check the specs, um the actual product versus the material specs that-that had been issued."
A7,715.560341,724.468245,"Veteran: And then, they'll make a determination, and there'll be a, a study, uh, and you'll get the findings from those studies and you'll- you'll send the product back. "
A7,724.933771,738.094319,"Veteran: If they send a product back, it's all good, and you use it- great, if you get it back and according to your own testing and your own measurements, the product is still out of specification,um-"
A7,738.987626,745.78179,"Veteran: There's really only a couple thngs you can do. Um, you probably just put it aside, you wouldn't use it, you'd scrap it."
A7,746.498952,759.923718,"Veteran: Um, that's a loss for you and the company. But then it also- you'd make a mark on that manufacturer um, so, part of the supply chain process is you evaluate and rate your suppliers."
A7,760.376662,766.931772,"Veteran: So you give em uh, you know a tick on this, on this one time, and you grade them, essentially."
A7,768.026388,776.015821,"Veteran: After a certain amount of grades and complaints, and you would probably, you know, go on to use a different supplier at that point."
A7,777.84018,788.962479,"Veteran: Um, and all the while, you have more than one supplier for each product. Um, you always have a backup, because one supplier can, you know, a lot of times it'll get there- raw materials from different place."
A7,789.226696,797.757147,"Veteran: So you wanna make sure that if one goes black, you can go to another vendor or supplier and they have stock."
Q8,800.122523,806.350507,"Interviewer: So in the uh, the finance side uh, obviously you-you're getting uh, you know supply from one- from one company. "
Q8,806.463743,820.001744,"Interviewer: I And uh, and you notice that well, you know the, that we've got a budget, and uh, and-and-and this invoice I just got is a- a little bit more than I thought it was going to be."
Q8,820.844724,825.034459,"Interviewer: Um, and then you look at it a little further and you say ""oh the price of this part"" [inaudible]-"
Q8,825.89002,827.009799,"Interviewer: What do you do with that?"
A8,828.84674,837.528172,"Veteran: Uh, [coughs] so there's a couple things. A lot of times, most of the time, you're purchasing product, you'll get- you'll get a quote, um- "
A8,839.06315,844.322336,"Veteran: Sometimes, it's common practice to have contractural rates for items."
A8,845.769241,851.405881,"Veteran: Uh, other times, depending on what the item is, the market can change, and they won't give you a contract rate."
A8,854.601655,859.772769,"Veteran: Certain plastics, um, are fall under that category. Um, but- "
A8,860.515094,869.460744,"Veteran: Before you- especially if you make an order for a large sum, you always get a quote- certified quote from the manufacturer before you place the order for that-"
A8,870.354051,876.720434,"Veteran: that material. If you get the material- place the order and you get the material, and they invoice you for more-"
A8,877.349524,885.137649,"Veteran: Then you either get- bring it up to manufacturer and you get more shipped, or you have- "
A8,886.571973,892.812538,"Veteran: the-the quote changed, or the uh, the invoice changed, or you cancel the invoice altogether."
A8,892.913193,899.996738,"Veteran: Um, so there's a range of ways you can solve manufacturing issues like that, all of which-"
A8,901.292662,902.726985,"Veteran: Are, are easily-"
A8,903.922255,916.202078,"Veteran: Uh, easily remedied. It's a common-common thing for this to happen. Um, manufacturers usually are really big, so there accounts- even though they do inventories, you know they can always be- "
A8,916.956985,926.179434,"Veteran: off a little bit. So if they, you say that- they say that they shipped a whole bunch, but you only actually got a little, or vise versa, um-"
A8,927.638921,934.017886,"Veteran: A lot of times you'll just cause they're just on a massive scale, and depending on the size of your company, they may not really care."
A8,934.307267,940.308779,"Veteran: Um, [coughs] so the key thing is getting a quote for each individual item you submit."
Q9,941.214668,951.695295,"Interviewer: Ok, an-and you're getting a widget, let's just say it's a widget, and it's uh, you know, the widget's a-advertised as uh, having an MTVF of, you know, ""x""."
Q9,952.613766,954.488452,"Interviewer: But, but, you've used it-"
Q9,956.287647,962.314322,"Interviewer: like say, a handful of times, 4 or 5 times, and it's consistently, you know, half that long."
Q9,963.685737,968.731033,"Interviewer: So, you-you-you're getting a lot- a lot more failures than you thought. What do you do in that instance? "
A9,970.089866,972.618805,"Veteran: Well, in that case, you'd - you'd wanna open a-"
A9,973.449203,979.828168,"Veteran: Uh, [coughs] an investigation into [inaudible] manufacturer. Um, they're obviously giving you defective product."
A9,980.432094,986.53426,"Veteran: It's either too long or too short. If you're not- specifications, uh, they should be very tight."
A9,986.924295,989.00029,"Veteran: uh, especially, depending on the industry-"
A9,990.522686,991.579556,"Veteran: I mean if there's- "
A9,993.026461,996.738088,"Veteran: That means there's a problem with their manufacturing process, and they're not catching it."
A9,997.304269,1004.803013,"Veteran: Um, and you need to immediately divert your secondary supplier um, until you can sort out that issue with the manufacturer."
A9,1005.318866,1011.987213,"Veteran: Um, and a lot of times, you-you use different vendors so, it might be that-"
A9,1013.081828,1018.743631,"Veteran: That-that was a bad batch from the manufacturer that went to that specific vendor, and it's not the manufacturer's- I mean it's not the vendor's fault."
A9,1018.970104,1026.83372,"Veteran: They just ship whatever you order from them. Um, so sometimes it can be hard to go directly to the manufacturer, depending on the size of your company."
A9,1027.135683,1034.79799,"Veteran: Um, so it's constant communication with your-your vendor representatives, um, and your quality control team."
A9,1035.85486,1038.107,"Veteran: That- that's how you [inaudible]. "
Q10,1038.308308,1044.976655,"Interviewer: Great great great, well, you know, they don't give us a lot of time to do these, so- so I have one last question, and that is uh-"
BCV,1044.976655,1045.479926,"Veteran: Yes sir."
Q10,1045.85738,1052.915761,"Interviewer: Um, were there- were there either any questions that you thought I'd ask that I didn't, or that you wanted me to ask that i didn't?"
A10,1054.702375,1055.532773,"Veteran: Um-"
A10,1057.583604,1060.854868,"Veteran: Most of the interviews [coughs]-"
A10,1061.798502,1065.434638,"Veteran: People ask where you think you could, where you think you could improve. "
A10,1066.843798,1067.409979,"Veteran: Uh-"
A10,1069.033029,1074.25447,"Veteran: And just about every interview, not- most people don't actually think about that, um-"
A10,1075.361667,1082.420049,"Veteran: When they do think about it, it's after an incident happens, and they-and they think back to what they could have done to make themselves better."
A10,1082.885575,1083.955027,"Veteran: Um-"
A10,1084.420553,1090.447228,"Veteran: But for me, the best way is to always be looking forward, and there's always something you can learn."
A10,1091.629916,1096.738121,"Veteran: Um, so your improvement is- is relative."
A10,1097.845318,1106.426096,"Veteran: [coughs] uh, never think that you know everything. Uh, but you just assume that there's nothing you can improve on."
IRR,1107.72202,1112.503099,"Interviewer: Ok, cool, cool. Well thanks very much for your time. I really really appreciate it."
IRR,1112.578589,1112.987666,"Veteran: Yes sir."
