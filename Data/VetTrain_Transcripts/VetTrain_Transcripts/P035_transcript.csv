A3,551.41,572.16,"Veteran: you know, I think the the thing i'm. I'm most proud of it's not. It's not any one particular event or a thing idea. I I think my.

So in the the two years as the chief, I was able to get that to progress that through. So just before I left we were. We were just shy of the version.

A5,975.72,977.65,"Veteran: Okay, Um,"
A5,980.03,986.149,"Veteran: see, I have a have a few, So i'm gonna try and pick one. That, I think was what's most most relevant."
A5,986.23,1002.589,"Veteran: Um, I would say I would go back to Paris Island as the as the G. Three operations training. We have a little bit convoluted way of how the Ring Board does It's a recruit training and it we conduct training at two sites."
A5,1002.599,1010.579,"Veteran: Uh we do fall under one once senior command, but that command"
A5,1011.609,1021.569,"Veteran: it doesn't provide as much guidance as you would expect, and I don't say that in a bad way. It is kind of the nature of"
A5,1021.61,1035.509,"Veteran: you know. The The geography and and and the demographics around Paris Island are very, very different from the demographics and and geography of San Diego, and you know our our headquarters in the Quantical,"
A5,1035.52,1055.329,"Veteran: and many times just by nature of how assignments go and may work. Ah, they don't always have the experience to understand those demographics and and and geographic differences, so it largely falls on the working relationship between two commanding generals and the two G three s"
A5,1055.36,1070.169,"Veteran: so so um before I got there, and it took over as a G. Three, I would say that that relationship relationship was strained, and the the two depots were not quite as aligned it should be"
A5,1070.18,1081.99,"Veteran: in how we do recur training and the period of instruction, the curriculum that's taught, and some policy issues as well."
A5,1082,1091.32,"Veteran: So I've worked real hard along along with my counterpart on in San Diego, and and you would miss if I, if I made it sound like I did all the work with that"
A5,1091.87,1101.579,"Veteran: between the two of us. Our efforts to to one establish our our own personal relationship with which we hadn't known each other before we took over those positions."
A5,1101.59,1126.789,"Veteran: And then our efforts. Ah! For both of us to make sure our staffs rely on, and that that we we collectively worked together to ensure that that the two depots were aligned as possible, and doing recruit training the same, so that the end product, which is the ones you're producing are consistent and the same, regardless of the came out of San Diego. But they came out of their asylum. So I think we did A."
A5,1126.8,1131.139,"Veteran: I believe we did a very good job of that. I think our bosses believe we did a very good job of that"
A5,1131.32,1142.44,"Veteran: um on my my last Eval from there. You know. My boss did comment that you know that the two depots were the most aligned that they had been in within the last decade."
A5,1143.49,1146.889,"Veteran: So I think that's that's probably the one of the"
IRR,1159.95,1161.6,"Interviewer: let's say, uh,"
IRR,1161.67,1180.719,"Interviewer: that's a great example. We're seeing more and more especially with the remote work today. So I would be hard pressed, probably to think of two further apart demographics,"
IRR,1180.73,1186.8,"Interviewer: San Diego and Paris Island. So well said,"
IRR,1189.42,1193.17,"Interviewer: what questions do you have for me"

IRR,1215.78,1232.14,"Veteran: you know? What? What would be expected of me over the next? You know ninety days, or you know, or yeah, three months or six months, You know where? Where, Where could I offer the most assistance? And where do you? What do you believe? It would be the first place to to to start at?"
IRR,1233.83,1239.64,"Interviewer: So I have a few responses here. First and foremost,"
IRR,1239.65,1257.729,"Interviewer: one of the things that I hear most frequently as feedback, especially from folks new to a team. A new to an organization is um. I want to. I want to roll my sleeves up. I want to learn the operation, and I want to learn that, you know I want to spend thirty, sixty ninety days learning things"
IRR,1257.74,1269.869,"Interviewer: before I start offering commentary. And for me personally, that's one of the most frustrating things. If you go in and on day three you see something being done wrong."
IRR,1269.88,1277.899,"Interviewer: I am looking for someone that's going to voice that you know the right way. But"
IRR,1278,1294.01,"Interviewer: oftentimes that fresh set of eyes we're bringing in outside pendant for a reason. We're looking for someone that's going to look at it with a unique perspective. And of course, yeah, you want to learn things as we go but you it's"
IRR,1294.03,1311.439,"Interviewer: it's integrals of the operation to make sure that we're being as efficient and productive as possible. So I would say, being courageous in your communication, both with your direct reports as well as up the chain with with your leader, saying, Hey,"
IRR,1311.45,1318.589,"Interviewer: why do we do this? And is there a reason that we are doing it more efficiently, you know"
IRR,1318.6,1322.36,"Interviewer: again, respectfully, but definitely a way to Bro. That."
IRR,1322.64,1324.09,"Interviewer: Um."
IRR,1324.18,1340.26,"Interviewer: And you know, within ninety days, I think really what you touched on with your with your last response, Building that rapport Um, laying the foundation early on, is going to review a lot of benefits down the line."
IRR,1340.27,1354.449,"Interviewer: So what success looks like at three months versus at twelve months? Um, i'd like to see strides in the operation, but I want the focus to be on the team building, certainly, and then from there"
IRR,1354.46,1363.049,"Interviewer: we can get more granular as we go on. But I think those are really where I've seen the most successful new leaders coming into the company."
IRR,1363.27,1370.05,"Veteran: Okay, that's that's That's very often that that is a is a helpful response. And you"

IRR,1386.68,1399.74,"Veteran: Um. So you know There, there's a right way to to voice concerns and the voice ah questions, or if something doesn't look right? No. So that's that's that's helpful."
IRR,1400.68,1412.94,"Veteran: The second question I would have is so day to day. What does a typical day look like for this? For this position in the organization,"
IRR,1414.15,1424.19,"Interviewer: you know, like most jobs today, we spend a lot more of our time sitting in meetings than we probably should."

IRR,1440.95,1448.11,"Interviewer: it seems to be more and more of our time is spent in these type of discussions."
IRR,1448.6,1460.689,"Interviewer: It's really what is being done in those meetings. So you know this things, are you? It might be four or five hours a day, but it's what contributions are you bringing?"
IRR,1460.91,1470.3,"Interviewer: And then, of course, there's the reporting side. There's a lot of looking at the daily reports we have."
IRR,1470.44,1488.049,"Interviewer: We have things that are aggregating all of our data. We're seeing those, and you know, trying to bump them up against what the goals are from the C suite, which is also"

IRR,1538.09,1544.44,"Interviewer: I don't know if you you heard that mantra a lot in the military, but it it"
IRR,1544.57,1555.82,"Interviewer: it's It's a big thing. Retention for us is A. You know they're not under contract, so it's a different level for sure. So"
