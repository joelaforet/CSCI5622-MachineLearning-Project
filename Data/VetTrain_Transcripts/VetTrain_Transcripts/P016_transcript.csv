BCV,0.322632,1.15303,"Veteran: Doing good, how are you?"
Q1,1.36692,6.965815,"Interviewer: Yeah, good, so, um, did they explain to you the position for which we're interviewing?"
BCV,7.582323,19.144984,"Veteran: Yeah, in a brief job posting for uh, data scientists with uh, with your company. It looks like you guys, uh,  have a pretty interesting mix of work like uh, doing consulting, training, a lot of cloud-based stuff."
Q1,19.748909,25.284895,"Interviewer: We do, we do. Um, yes, and I see that y-you did a lot with uh, comm and communications."
Q1,26.228529,37.766026,"Interviewer: Um, and uh, yeah, here at uh, at Ft. Cambell as well as uh, you know, overseas for Enduring Freedom. Well, you were in the 101st, huh?"
BCV,38.344789,39.879766,"Veteran: Yes sir, you a veteran yourself sir?"
Q1,40.018166,42.685505,"Interviewer: I am, yes, yes 4 years, 4 years."
BCV,42.962304,43.302012,"Veteran: Which branch?"
Q1,43.302012,44.006592,"Interviewer: I was in the Army."
BCV,44.434373,46.057423,"Veteran: OK, cool. What base were you at?"
Q1,46.711676,53.531004,"Interviewer: Well, uh, I spent 90% of my time overseas uh, through-throughout Europe- Germany, Italy, uh-"
BCV,53.606495,53.870712,"Veteran: Oh, interesting."
Q1,54.034275,55.430854,"Interviewer: Spent a lot of time in Turkey."
BCV,56.122852,63.357379,"Veteran: I had a twin who had the same MMOS as me, and he uh, he was in [inaudible] in the same time frame as me, roughly. "
Q1,63.659341,66.993515,"Interviewer: Oh wow, Graf, yeah, yep, spent some time in Graf, yep."
Q1,68.666892,82.381039,"Interviewer: Interesting, interesting, yeah. It seems like, uh, and-and uh, so it seems like the uh, the position here, uh, that it's talking about is an assistant research, uh scientist, and it looks like you've got a lot of stuff going."
Q1,83.010128,99.857139,"Interviewer: Uh, in that area, for your PHD, um, you know, some of the uh, requirements are able to multitask, work properly with others, um, you know, and then communication skills and efficiency with common programming languages- C, C++, and Python."
Q1,100.410737,117.19484,"Interviewer: Um, and I'm wondering you know, how do you think uh, your-your uh, military career and your work experience, so far uh, has-has augmented uh, your experience relative to the job description?"
A1,118.490764,128.291975,"Veteran: Uh, I think it's, um, advantageous for learning processors, uh, particularly I've seen consulting with one area that you guys uh, do a lot of work in."
A1,129.021718,149.152575,"Veteran: Um, my-my experience has been pretty diverse, I've done, um, you know, of course, the Army experience, but then also I've worked in two different industries, once in land surveying at small businesses and corporate companies that were about 300 people in size, um, I worked at Harvard for a couple years."
A1,149.806828,159.557712,"Veteran: Managing a bioengineering lab, and that was uh, you know very uh, support-focused role, maintaining a lot of equipment, similar to what I did as a [inaudible] guy in the Army."
A1,160.211965,178.455554,"Veteran: Um, also helping to manage projects, write proposals, and uh, I think that experience helps me to, pretty quickly, um, grasp, uh, new problems uh, especially, I think, a lot more like, in a project-focused way."
A1,178.56879,198.611575,"Veteran: Uh, at a higher level than just typing technical specs um, I'm a lot more interested in, you know, why you would want to do something, um, you know early on. If I'm meeting someone new, to discuss a project, I think that, that's usually the funnest part of any any uh, new endeavor is the ideation step or, connecting with new people."
A1,198.963865,215.848621,"Veteran: And uh, you know, the starting steps, uh, technical requirements are all [inaudible] as well, but uh, I-I think, most of my prior experience is really good for uh, you know, that higher level, like, project focus and team management."
A1,216.175748,217.974943,"Veteran: Uh, would work."
Q2,218.679523,230.783201,"Interviewer: That's a good segue. When-when you're selecting someone for a team, uh, you know, pick a type of team, whatever you want- um, you know, and you said you'd like to know about them and why they wanna do what they wanna do, what kind of questions do you ask them?"
BCV,232.884359,236.734386,"Veteran: Um, if I'm choosing team members? Or..."
Q2,236.935694,248.888391,"Interviewer: Yeah, if you're choosing team members, you wanna add somebody to the team, and you mentioned, you know, you'd like to know why are you doing this, I mean, other than just asking them, ""well why do you want to do this?"", is there some kind of fishing type questions, "
A2,248.9513,263.068063,"Veteran: Yeah, in my last job, my favorite interview question was to ask someone um, you know, what-what is the job you want after this one?  [laughter] Because a lot of people, uh, tend to have long term ideas about what their career goals are, and um-"
A2,264.250751,274.353925,"Veteran: You know y-your job is most likely an intermediate step for them so it's nice to know, is uh, that question usually runs someone into a, you know-"
A2,276.744464,293.138531,"Veteran: Exposing if they are, uh, considering your job as a very temporary one, or if they're thinking pretty long term, uh, how much they know about your company, how much they know about their industry, and where they want to be in their industry. Uh, so I really love, heh, uh, asking people that question when interviewing them."
A2,293.377585,305.368027,"Veteran: Um, but also, trying to reconnect as we did about uh, backgrounds, uh, lived in Boston, Nashville- well not Nashville, but close to Nashville um, New Orleans, "
BCI,305.443518,306.613624,"Interviewer: Knoxville?"
A2,307.167222,329.27342,"Veteran: Uh, yes, heh, uh, trying to connect with people over geography or, uh, mutual relationships um, once you start getting into technical things then, uh, you know project experience- I've done a lot of spatial stuff, and I've done a lot of bio- you know, bio work, and uh, you know I have my own interest in statistics and data science of course."
A2,329.525055,346.736938,"Veteran: I-I'd say those three things- like uh, trying to figure out where you're trying to go in your career, um, how can- if I'm uh, in a hiring position then, how can I help facilitate that, um, what experiences do you have in your personal [inaudible] and your professional life that we connect on."
A2,346.736938,365.936743,"Veteran: Those are, I'd say, probably the biggest things, and then um, especially when hiring people my uh, and my biggest concern is-is trying to get a good team fit, just, er-, are we gonna be culturally compatible? That's gonna be a first step to having a stable, um, teammate to me."
Q3,366.666487,368.427937,"Interviewer: A-and what do you look for in a team fit?"
A3,370.365532,386.281491,"Veteran: Um, I think stability, confidence that the person can um, pro- like, so if I'm joining a team, then stability is the biggest thing, like I feel like I'm gonna, uh, comfortable match with uh the organization that I'm joining."
A3,386.533126,406.399766,"Veteran: And then, if I'm on the other side of the table, it's the same thing, just inverted, you know, trying to quickly probe, and then interview, um, is the person that we're hiring going to- to fit well in the organization, uh, do I think that their-their interests and goals match with our team."
A3,406.475257,426.71935,"Veteran: Do I think that their technical expertise is something we need right now? Uh, I can think specifically, the last time I was doing interviews, uh, was for a uh, joint position at a- at Boston children's hospital and we were uh, hiring someone to-to take on like a new type of process control and uh-"
A3,427.56233,443.365053,"Veteran: Uh, I think quality, uh, quality and process control and process control were the two things we needed most and uh, someone's technical skillset so I was very interested in um, you know that skill for anyone who's interviewing at us, um, wondering "
A3,444.421922,466.125503,"Veteran: How much experience they had in the domain we were working in and also, um, what from their previous experience would, would um, expand what we were doing because we really hated someone who didn't do process control well, uh, to understand like, how much variability there was in this particular thing we were doing."
A3,466.502956,474.643372,"Veteran: Um, how to control that, measure it, hopefully reduce the variability, processes, uh, very noisy."
Q4,476.216095,491.867836,"Interviewer: And that's uh- that's a great uh, so um, you know, talking about quality and process control, you're, let's say you're leading a team and you've got somebody that says ""you know, this, th- you know, I'm doing some QA on this, some quality, some verification on this, and it- it's not within spec"" "
Q4,491.943327,508.865829,"Interviewer: So they, they turn it back to whoever gave it to them and say ""now this, this is out of spec, and we need to get it back in spec"", and the person they gave it to says ""Mmm, no, it's within the spec, the way we understand it""- and then you have that back and forth, ""no it isn't"", ""yes it is"", a-and how do you arbitrate something like that?"
A4,510.048517,515.068649,"Veteran: Try go get every- both parties into the same room and have a meeting to discuss it and, um-"
A4,517.283044,527.499454,"Veteran: With the person who's asserting that it's out of spec, I would ask them ""what have you done to test it?"" And then with the person who's arguing that it is in spec, I'd ask, ""what process are you using to try to see where is the difference?"""
A4,527.587526,542.83665,"Veteran: Um, that's, I think, and I come down to a difference, and how something's being measured, so just get into a room and have a meeting, I think the easiest way to solve that would be over lunch, or uh, with everyone in one-one room having a conversation together."
Q5,543.667048,544.811991,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah."
Q5,545.805952,557.620249,"Interviewer: Great. So, did you notice, in uh uh, in the job description, and there's a modicum of programming- C, C++, and Python- are you comfortable answering maybe some high-level C++ questions?"
A5,558.538719,564.511704,"Veteran: Uh, C++, I'm pretty limited in, uh, Python and R are the two languages I've done the most work in, but I can-"
BCI,564.605174,565.244811,"Interviewer: Which one?"
A5,565.697755,571.183414,"Veteran: Python and R are the two languages I've worked most in, but I could do some - I could try some high-level C++."
Q6,571.64894,576.631327,"Interviewer: Uh, really, yeah reall is, I mean uh, simple questions. Like uh, "
Q6,578.543758,580.707825,"Interviewer: Do you know how to define a class in C++?"
A6,582.494439,594.97557,"Veteran: Uh, I think it would just be 'class', you would just say 'class', and then declare whatever you're going to name it, and then um, I think classes in C++ are actually the thing I'd be weakest on um-"
BCI,595.088806,596.03244,"Interviewer: Ok, ok."
A6,596.03244,603.594094,"Veteran: I've done, uh a lot of data science stuff but not much with um, object-oriented programming in a low-level language like C++."
Q7,604.034456,616.163297,"Interviewer: It is, uh, yeah I mean it's-it's, I don't know if you've uh, heh, know it or not, but C++ was invented at A&M, so I didn't know if you'd actually had a chance to go through that program or not. Um-"
BCV,616.163297,618.390274,"Veteran: I didn't know that actually. Uh-"
Q7,618.440601,635.904119,"Interviewer: Oh yeah, Dr. [inaudible] was the guy that wrote the language and came up with it, um, uh, so, so yeah. Everybody, I mean even-even today- even though C++ is, eh, pretty antiquated, um, you know, they still teach it at A&M as-as a primary thing. "
Q7,635.904119,638.407895,"Interviewer: So, why- you said you're ok with Python right, ?"
BCV,638.760185,639.112475,"Veteran: Mm-hmm. "
Q7,639.376692,644.824605,"Interviewer: Yeah, so um, if you had to describe Python to somebody, what would you say it is?"
A7,646.586055,659.998239,"Veteran: Uh, I really like saying it's a glue language, it's great for writing really fast scripts to do something that you know you're going to do several times or even if you're doing something that's very boutique, it's just a very efficient language to-"
A7,662.300706,673.81304,"Veteran: Um, put things together. uh, so I'd say if you have a bunch of code that  the- a bunch of disparate code and you need a way of cobbling it together quickly, Python is a great language for doing that. "
A7,673.913694,685.463773,"Veteran: It's um, beyond the language, it's an ecosystem, uh it has incredible documentation and there's a library for almost anything that you could ever want to do. "
Q8,686.382244,692.647973,"Interviewer: You know what, uh, the two types of uh, uh, of data types there are?"
BCV,697.366143,699.291156,"Veteran: Could you, uh, clarify?"
Q8,699.354065,710.916726,"Interviewer: Um, there's uh, a type checking- can be done in like, two stages. And, there's two data types that are checked before execution."
BCV,713.005302,713.772791,"Veteran: Uh...."
Q8,714.037009,716.427548,"Interviewer: Well, one's before execution and one's during execution."
BCV,719.761721,722.491969,"Veteran: Ok. Classes and instances, but um,  "
Q8,722.592623,727.289605,"Interviewer: I was just talking. It-it's more simple that- I'll just tell you, it's static and dynamic data types."
BCV,727.33634,730.156017,"Veteran: Ok, uh, not familiar with those but uh-"
Q8,730.280094,730.670129,"Interviewer: Yeah."
Q8,733.601685,741.855337,"Interviewer: Um, ok then, how about a scope? What's a scope in- you know what a scope is in Python?"
A8,742.949952,749.693789,"Veteran: Uh it's uh, your function or class scope, it's gonna say if you have a variable um, as a global or as a local."
BCI,749.932843,752.738581,"Interviewer: Mm-hmm, yeah. Perfect."
BCI,752.952472,768.730031,"Interviewer: Um, yeah, uh, like I said I was just going to ask high-level ones. Obviously we're not in the same room, so I'm not going to ask you to write anything out or um, you know uh,"
A8,768.843267,783.274575,"Veteran: I'd say most of my experience has been, a lot more uh, numerically-focused.  I've done uh, uh, took several courses toward the data science degree, done some projects, but they were all um-"
A8,784.532754,808.148766,"Veteran: Mostly either writing libraries to do specific algorithims that are fitting stuff or uh, so like you're trying to learn a model with statistic regression of [inaudible] spreadsheet a few times. Um, done lasso regression, and stretch, uh, and a couple of applied projects where instead of you know, writing a [inaudible] algorithim of, just imported [inaudible] learner-something  similar- "
BCI,808.224256,812.061701,"Interviewer: So numbers, you-you-you've used lists and tuples and-"
A8,812.137192,817.106997,"Veteran: Yes. Uh, Numpy, Pandas, Numpy, Pandas, [inaudible] learn extensively. "
BCI,817.559941,818.126122,"Interviewer: Ok. "
A8,820.906696,827.851842,"Veteran: Little bit of image work, too. Um, open CV for uh, trying to stitch things."
IRR,828.279623,828.808058,"Interviewer: Mm-kay."
IRR,831.198597,839.276104,"Interviewer: Um, in your uh, looking at your uh- it's expected you'll get your PHD in '26, huh?"
IRR,839.980684,840.483955,"Veteran: Yes sir,"
IRR,841.100462,855.821152,"Interviewer: Nice, nice. Went to Harvard. I have been to Harvard. I mean, I didn't go there for school, I just visited it. My brother lived in Boston, he lived in Newton actually, so- I did the tour of Harvard while I was up there"
IRR,856.626386,858.501072,"Veteran: That's uh, that's a fun one."
IRR,862.539825,877.172442,"Veteran: Had my boss give it- he gave like one when he was a tenured faculty member.and he gave one. We had like, some visitors. One time, I think he started out on Cambridge common, which you may know is where General Washington took command of the Regimental Army.  "
IRR,877.449241,878.254476,"Interviewer: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah."
IRR,878.770329,889.829719,"Veteran: They started there, walked into the yard, and gave like a veterean-centric uh, tour that was uh, really cool experience, different from what you'd get from other tour guides in the square."
IRR,889.905209,898.020461,"Veteran: But the guys in the square have a great history, uh, but universitie's almost 400 years old so it has uh-"
IRR,898.020461,910.161884,"Interviewer: Oh yeah, a storied history, oh my God, it's a great history. He told some really interesting ones like uh, the one, uh, student that stole the book out of the library, and the library burnt down but he saved the book and got kicked out of school because he stole the book-"
IRR,910.828719,911.344572,"Interviewer: [coughs]"
IRR,912.52726,921.284183,"Interviewer: But then, the-the-the one uh, is the library that has the uh, the new library that has the the room that has flowers in it that have to be changed every day?"
IRR,921.586146,935.805463,"Veteran: Yeah yeah, uh, the student who um, it's named after a kid named I think Harry Whitener. Whitener is the last name for sure. He graduated and then died on the Titanic, and his mom, um yeah, endowed the library to Harvard. "
Q9,935.879054,939.464863,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah yeah. Some interesting stories. Interesting."
Q9,942.006384,956.9158,"Interviewer: So um, u-u-uh you um, you listed that you uh, you were uh, you-you established and maintained and improved digital and voice communications networks across multiple bases for Enduring Freedom."
Q9,957.532307,969.371768,"Interviewer: Um, if you had to describe the improvement, you said you improved the communications, so- what  did you do to improve it and what was the measureable uh, effect of that?"
A9,969.887621,986.633978,"Veteran: Sure, uh, the main metric for us was range of communication and um- for voice networks, anyways, it was range. For digital networks it was speed, uh, so we deployed to Kandahar, there was one FOB and two small combat outposts there when we got there."
A9,986.910777,1003.040626,"Veteran: Uh, they were all radio to voice, um, satellite communications, and some HF stuff. Uh, so we came in for the- for the VHF stuff, we just added um, there was a mountain to our south at the very southern border of our AO."
A9,1003.317426,1033.828256,"Veteran: So we put a retran station on the mountaintop, and that expanded the range that we could do, you know, patrol communications at. Uh, so the biggest concern for us was having, a fires net that uh you know, we could call for mortars, artillery, um, air support when we got it, which was mostly helicopters- talking to helicopters didn't really um, you know we didn't really have any restrictions there, helicopter's up in- pretty high up above the ground. "
A9,1033.891165,1036.583667,"Veteran: And so, you can talk to them pretty easily. "
BCI,1036.961121,1038.445771,"Interviewer: All [inaudible] stuff, yeah. "
A9,1038.659662,1053.770386,"Veteran: But uh, talking from the FOBs was really hard, especially when folks got into villages because you'd have these mud walls, and they're like, you know, 3 feet wide, and that- that uh, mud would just eat the uh, the radio uh, singal so you'd get-"
A9,1054.776929,1072.164957,"Veteran: So the main-main goal was setting up retran stations, and we did 2 of them, one on the mountaintop which I supported as a battallion-level commo guy and went down to a company-level and we'd set up another one at a small top so we had-we were expanding westward, and we set up a retran station there."
A9,1073.448299,1080.833808,"Veteran: And then, that allowed us to push farther south and west, uh, so those would be the two main things, uh-"
A9,1082.406531,1101.656663,"Veteran: We're constantly repositioning antennaes, trying to improve the antennaes, um, I'm sure you know like, when you're doing expeditionary things, antennae you set up the first time is not the best. Uh, the best setup you can get, um, we had to, to um, re-run some cabling a few times, coax cables mostly, the stuff that had been weathered or holed-"
A9,1102.285752,1113.722595,"Veteran: Uh, when we got out to the base, but it was the stuff available, and we needed to um, you getget comm stations set up efficiently so, um"
BCI,1114.112631,1114.729138,"Interviewer: Was it bad?"
A9,1116.264116,1130.506697,"Veteran: That and um, just regrounding systems, trying- once things were set up, just trying to work out any bugs that were in uh, uh, systems that you can communicate more effectively. "
A9,1130.506697,1148.146361,"Veteran: With digital stuff, we'd set up, we'd use uh, these things that are called ""snap terminals"" that are just pure satellite communications and then, but over the time we were able to get some uh, fiber optic lines ran, and then there was an HF antennae you could use to do, basically, cable internet-"
A9,1148.146361,1154.097546,"Veteran: -speeds. It wasn't quite that fast, but it was lightyears faster than the satellite communications. "
Q10,1154.361763,1162.099561,"Interviewer: Oh, yeah. Are you about done? Ok. Well I have one more question for him, and then I'm done. Ok."
BCV,1162.099561,1162.79156,"Veteran: Yes sir."
Q10,1162.942541,1171.535901,"Interviewer: Uh, just one more question. So, is there anything that you thought I was going to ask that I didn't, or that you wanted me to ask that I didn't?"
A10,1172.064336,1180.280242,"Veteran: Um, I was surprised by the level of the programming questions, those were uh, higher level [inaudible] than I expected, uh-"
A10,1184.042196,1204.160471,"Veteran: I guess I would've also- I wasn't sure what to expect for the uh, for the team interview, like, to be honest, I haven't done that many job interviews, um, the ones I've had were with my survey stuff I did through- I knew- I knew a couple business owners, my dad was a sales guy, so I knew-"
