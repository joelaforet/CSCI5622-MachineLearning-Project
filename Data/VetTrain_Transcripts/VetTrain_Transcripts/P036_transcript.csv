A1,80.9828,91.532464,"Veteran: Um. And so, ten years after I finished, my bachelors went back to school absolutely loved, being back in school, which I think was just the maturation process, kind of knowing what it would do for me and all that good stuff. So um"
A1,92.168269,98.691164,"Veteran: finished my masters and kept working on education. And then that actually brought me to um. I went from that was from University of Florida."

A1,133.519184,134.319828,"Veteran: haha, that's all good. "
Q2,134.508215,138.205307,"Interviewer: That's fantastic you you are, uh, well, you earned that title."
Q2,139.217886,142.114334,"Interviewer: That's fantastic. Um love hearing that."
Q2,142.773688,143.998203,"Interviewer: Uh"
Q2,144.940137,155.93722,"Interviewer: So you talked a little bit about um, you know, working in teams focusing on the higher education. Um, have a a bit of a passion for that. Uh, with that."

A2,176.871709,192.672657,"Veteran: had good teams, had not good teams and had the good supervisors and not good supervisors. Uh, I think it's always more enjoyable when you have a good one. Um, I have an excellent supervisor right now, and excellent teams. I guess I would focus on that one. Um, so i'm a relatively new position. But I've taught as an adjunct for several years."
A2,193.02,210.119536,"Veteran: Um! Well, I was teaching full time at uh Sam Houston state and part time at A&M. So now i'm full time at A&M. Um. I think the most important thing to me is the team cohesion and the trust. Um, everybody trust one another to to do their job. So. Um."
A2,210.119536,214.999,"Veteran: There's some autonomy there, which is, which is nice. Um! And and then, you know,"
A2,215.18,229.179,"Veteran: if I need something or need help or need information, I can go find it as well. So, um, that's a balance that I really like is uh being trusted with the work, and then um, I don't have a problem asking questions or asking for help. So if I need to do that I want to be able to do that as well."
A2,229.502287,234.376797,"Veteran: Um, so it's a It's a really refreshing enjoyable place to work"
Q3,236.119375,238.568405,"Interviewer: okay, umm"
Q3,240.664208,241.559046,"Interviewer: fantastic."
Q3,242.32,245.891944,"Interviewer: So let me pivot just a little bit. Um,"
Q3,247.2,252.344193,"Interviewer: tell me about the accomplishment you're most proud of, and that can be either personal or professional."
A3,252.744515,258.537411,"Veteran: Hm, well, that's a This is a pretty good list. There's a few in there. Um,"
A3,259.14,270.199,"Veteran: I would say. One of the things earliest in my life was uh I So i'm married, and I have kids now, and all that good stuff. So um, but before that uh, I was so uh lifeguarded a country club"
A3,270.24,275.809,"Veteran: during the summers in college, and uh, I was teaching a friend's son how to swim"
A3,275.93,278.459,"Veteran: um, and he had um"
A3,279,289.969,"Veteran: uh a lot. He had some very severe medical issues and had part of his brain actually removed to reduce seizures. So a speech and communication were extremely challenging. Um, and he was."
A3,290.03,300.55,"Veteran: He was eleven, twelve years old, you know, not water safe around the pool. Um, and I was, I think, twenty-one years old, um, you know, and obviously never had kids and stuff like that before."
A3,300.56,320.049,"Veteran: Um, and by the end of the summer he was water safe and able to swim. And really it was just, you know. One word commands one word, sentences was all he could really understand and say. So had to be very simple. But um, in my early life, looking back, that was probably one of my my proudest accomplishments, because it really helped me understand and appreciate a lot of things and grow up a lot."
A3,320.2,337.279,"Veteran: Um, So that's something uh with the back, and you know professionally recently. Um, in addition to you know, just watching my daughter grow up and thrive. But but getting the Phd is big deal for me, and then um in the Air Force. I recently became a first sergeant. Um, which which means a lot to me for the impact I can have on on fellow air."
BCI,340.36,341.44,"Interviewer: Excellent"
BCI,344.771495,356.475028,"Interviewer: sounds like uh sounds like teaching, and training is something that's uh. Well in your wheelhouse. It sounds like that's where the real passion for um, for this position comes from"
A3,357.699543,359.065347,"Veteran: Yeah, Absolutely"
Q4,360.93,361.77,"Interviewer: sorry."
Q4,362.13,363.18,"Interviewer: Excellent"
Q4,363.25,364.37,"Interviewer: Um,"
Q4,364.54,365.79,"Interviewer: i'm going to."
Q4,366.67,372.23,"Interviewer: I'm gonna continue with questions. But before I go with uhh"
Q4,372.5,374.35,"Interviewer: before I go down my list"
Q4,374.72,388.08,"Interviewer: uh something that I noticed with your resume, and it was it was interesting. Um, most veterans that we interview have a very military heavy"
Q4,388.09,406.727222,"Interviewer: um resume It's a lot of of their their progression, their steps Um. Obviously promotions look a little bit different in um in the military sector, sometimes, and in the private sector and looking over yours, it's almost one hundred percent educationally based."
Q4,407.292382,409.458831,"Interviewer: Um, do you? Uh,"
Q4,410.447862,417.206241,"Interviewer: can you? Can you, uh expound on your military experience a little bit. I would like to hear a little bit more there,"
A4,417.59,419.759,"Veteran: sure. Yeah. So um"
A4,419.79,438.789,"Veteran: again as I was exploring options uh, you know to me uh serving as a calling, and even though I grew up around it was military brat. Uh, they added, Serve Brother just finished offshore Candidates school for Marine Corps uh the week before 9/11. Um, and so I never really had that calling um until I was sitting in a cubicle"
A4,438.8,444.139,"Veteran: fresh out of school and kind of felt that calling, and then had to figure out. You know what I wanted to do, and and uh,"
A4,444.16,463.139,"Veteran: I had learned enough to know they were not guarantees in the military, so I was pursuing different options. I wanted to fly and all that good stuff. So it took me a while to to get where I want to go, and and had some different opportunities. So I ended up enlisting um because I was having a hard time getting what I wanted, especially the economy tanked everybody with a degree, was still in the military"
A4,463.15,465.19,"Veteran: um for a number of reasons. So"
A4,465.28,477.15,"Veteran: I ended up enisting um, and then staying on that path. Um, I So that was part time international guard, which gave me the opportunity to um serve, and then obviously grow my civilian career."
A4,477.19,493.549,"Veteran: Um actually was selected as an officer at one point. Um, and then I moved to a civilian job, it took like it, took like a year because they um. The Air Force used to separate prior enlisted and obstacle candidate school, and then they merged them together. But when they did, it created this big backlog."
A4,493.56,511.919,"Veteran: So I waited around for like a year after I got notified um that I was going to be an officer. Um, and it, and it still hadn't happened, and then I had a a civilian job opportunity to move, and that was the only thing keeping us in place was my part time military career. So um! They tried to move it with me. Obviously that didn't work on to new unit um. And then I realized"
A4,511.93,515.599,"Veteran: you know what I I can still serve and do well on on the um"
A4,515.66,527.769,"Veteran: uh on the enlisted side. Uh which is why I've pursued the first starter position, the challenge for me, and why some things took a while was because I kept moving units. Um, and as a part timer it's really hard to kind of start over"
A4,527.78,543.74,"Veteran: um, because that you're the new guy, and you gotta come in and build trust and all that good stuff, and show that you're capable. So. Um! I would say that definitely slowed my career. And then again, some units I were at were excellent, supportive, uh developmental, all that good stuff. Some were very much not. So, um."
A4,543.83,560.629059,"Veteran: So you learn from those lessons. But uh, yeah, I was part timer my entire career. So eighteen years and counting um, uh. So plenty of experience in there. But but yeah, it's. I've had dual roles uh my, my entire, uh, since I've been listed. I've worked civilian and and military."
BCI,562.77,569.238963,"Interviewer: I'm gonna say two things there uh one first and foremost. Uh, truly, thank you for your service "
A4,569.681852,570.058626,"Veteran: thank you."
Q5,570.122088,576.69254,"Interviewer: that it really does mean the world to uh to many of us that have not uh have not found that calling"
Q5,577.099585,584.868586,"Interviewer: Uh, second. And this is actually pretty impressive but uh, many of the folks that we interview uh"
Q5,585.011833,588.119432,"Interviewer: um especially military, uh, they"
Q5,588.34,602.20643,"Interviewer: that the transition is difficult coming into a civilian role. Uh, and it sounds like you have found fulfillment in both areas that is unique, um, and I think that is something that you should be thankful for."
Q5,602.743745,618.87437,"Interviewer: Um, I got two last questions for you. Um! We'll make. We'll make them pretty easy. But, uh, I think this will probably drive to the heart of what we're we're trying to do with the interview. Tell me about a time when you took an innovative approach to solving a problem."
A5,620.687593,622.948236,"Veteran: Well, that's always a good question. Right? Um,"
A5,625.821135,628.278648,"Veteran: Where to draw from Um,"
A5,628.55,631.06,"Veteran: think about. Come up with a specific example,"
A5,633.53,639.009,"Veteran: I think, in my experiences I've gotten older and and mature is"
A5,639.19,643.579,"Veteran: um. The way I can innovate is kind of slow down and step back"
A5,643.61,660.22,"Veteran: um as if I was younger. It was, you know, solve the problem, fix it, Move on right away. But um! But I really try and step back and work with with people. Um, I guess an example recently was, um, uh, I had a student who was really not engaged,"
A5,660.23,676.58,"Veteran: not passing, not showing up to class all those good things. Um, and I had actually, you know, Post Covid. Uh, I had used Youtube and a lot of online learning and stuff like that during Covid. Um, And so I would record classes and all that good stuff. So um, I continue to do that um, which is"
A5,676.59,692.35,"Veteran: a little risky and challenging because the classes I teach are actually ethical leadership, and we talk about very serious subjects. Um! And so, um, you know, something could be taken out of context if they wanted to. Um probably used against me at some point. But um! I kept doing that,"
A5,692.36,697.3,"Veteran: and I had a student who actually saw a lot of potential in, but I think they had a lot of very severe"
A5,697.34,709.369,"Veteran: um issues outside of class with it, and I I don't know what some of them were, but I I think there was severe depression and anxiety, and a lot of different things. But when the person was there they were really engaged and had a lot to offer."
A5,709.38,728.56,"Veteran: So um! I actually went out of my way to make sure that that person got through the semester, pass the class so they could remain a student, they could remain in the core cadets and all of those good things. So I use that technology uh to do that. So I guess the opportunity there being innovative was one just the technology side."
A5,728.57,733.089,"Veteran: But to I really kind of went out of my way to understand and help this this student Um"
A5,733.14,734.03,"Veteran: uh,"
A5,734.17,738.741947,"Veteran: in in order to to keep them in engaged and enroll in school."
Q6,742.87,745.94,"Interviewer: Last question I have for you. Um!"
Q6,746.69,748.919,"Interviewer: What part of your career excites you?"
Q6,749.02,754.596183,"Interviewer: And with that what would you say is the most difficult part of your current role day to day?"
A6,754.97,772.199,"Veteran: Uh so it's all the same answer. So teaching and helping a fellow airman on the side uh teaching is something I absolutely love. I feel honored and privileged to get to do it. I never thought I would do it at this level. Um! It's also the the challenge. Uh, for a lot of reasons I can't get students to care."
A6,772.21,791.27,"Veteran: uh as much as I want to and try to. Um. That's that's their decision. So um uh, I absolutely love what I do uh every day. I love the opportunity I have. I love to interact with young people who are going on to accomplish tremendous things. Um! They are also extremely frustrating It's It's like your kids. There's nothing you love more, and it'll make you more angry"
A6,791.28,807.359,"Veteran: uh than your own children. Um! It's so same way. And then in in the Air Force side. Um! It's uh it's It's helping my fellow airmen out. So, having been around a little bit, having done different things, whether it's keeping them in the military where it's exploring civilian careers, whether it's doing both."
A6,807.37,815.059,"Veteran: Um! I really want to try to help, uh, especially young people. There's challenges with people of all ages and retirement, and the transitions"
A6,815.13,831.549,"Veteran: um in the civilian sector, and all that good stuff. But I really try to uh enjoy helping those airmen who don't know what they want to do or where they want to go. Um, and that's also extremely challenging and frustrating, because again, some of them are just unlimited potential, but they don't always see it in themselves. Or Don't always realize it. So"
A6,831.56,837.954556,"Veteran: uh I really it's one of the same love teaching love helping people. But uh, but that's challenging and frustrating, too."
IRR,839.29,858.9796,"Interviewer: I understand. You uh, you really hit home with the with your own kid analogy. Um, I couldn't relate more to that Um. And as soon as you said that uh everything else was uh describing way past the close, so haha, good good analyogy."
IRR,859.190505,862.194083,"Interviewer: uh, that's the questions I have. What questions do you have for us? "
IRR,862.505671,871.052092,"Veteran: uh you know typically what I would ask in this scenario, you you know, is what is the ideal candidate, um. That's always the close follow up question I tend to ask. "
IRR,871.736627,918.352987,"Interviewer: yeah, for sure. Umm. I would say, uh, there's a few different things that tie into this, uh first and foremost uh the position is fairly complex, obviously we have the educational requirement. Um, telling someone that they have to be uh analytical and professional while also being able to manage administrative and HR operations. Um, so it's kind of a unique skill set that we're looking for. Um, experience in the professional sector, in the school environment I think is absolutely going to be key. Uh, one of the points you talked about uh, trying to get the uh airmen to uh care."
IRR,918.385922,927.879,"Interviewer: Um, I think generally uh working with grad students post docs. Um, Generally speaking, those folks have have committed"
IRR,927.92,943.82,"Interviewer: um. So getting the buy-in is a little easier but giving them the guidance. Uh, certainly, some of our our candidates have some professional experience. Uh, but a lot of them are kids right? So so I think that um"
IRR,944.31,951.54,"Interviewer: the guidance is just as important in helping them, uh, get their lives where they want them to be"
IRR,951.64,963.515742,"Interviewer: so, and being able, of course, to manage up, manage down. That stuff is always going to be key, um, and then just being able to ask for help,"
IRR,963.645864,977.629,"Interviewer: Uh, but ultimately we want someone that's going to go in, and is going to be able to bring their expertise, look for holes in the operation, tell us what we can do more efficiently, and not reinvent the wheel."
IRR,978.175201,991.668409,"Interviewer: Um! So some of us receptive to you know how we do things, but also look and tell us how we can do things better. Um! And I think, having a genuine care for the students is, you know, probably first and foremost,"
IRR,992.351312,992.680989,"Veteran: great"
IRR,992.680989,996.722367,"Interviewer: uh, it's going to be, uh, a top top top requirement"
IRR,997.013886,997.67324,"Veteran: awesome."
IRR,999.321625,1000.40485,"Interviewer: Any other questions."
IRR,1000.922914,1003.301298,"Veteran: No, I think that's it. Thank you. I appreciate it"
IRR,1004.478715,1007.586995,"Interviewer: Alright. Sounds good, I hope you have a wonderful day. "
IRR,1007.846131,1009.070645,"Veteran: Thanks, appreciate it. "
