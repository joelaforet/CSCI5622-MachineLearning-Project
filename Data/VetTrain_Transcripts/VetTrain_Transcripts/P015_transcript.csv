Q1,0.649,4.48906,"Interviewer: So <NAME>, I guess they gave you the job description for which we're interviewing."
BCV,5.041131,6.541201,"Veteran: Yes sir, I have it with me right here."
Q1,6.772625,14.50998,"Interviewer: Ok, so you had a chance to read it. So, so you know obviously this is a senior IT information technology manager, um."
Q1,15.402215,30.272647,"Interviewer: And this is a university position, I would, given the-the, the description of me, I think in a, uh, non-university setting, people might call this, like, a CIO I think."
Q1,30.296936,38.315938,"Interviewer: This is a pretty, uh, pretty expansive, uh, job description that requires a lot of different skills. "
Q1,38.943973,46.801603,"Interviewer: And uh, I noticed that uh, your uh, current studies, uh, that you're due to complete in 2022 I think?"
BCV,47.202378,47.522693,"Veteran: Yes sir."
Q1,47.530286,51.234424,"Interviewer: Is, is, a PHD in information technology. Correct?"
BCV,51.805225,52.335188,"Veteran: Yes sir."
Q1,52.825381,60.355104,"Interviewer: So with that, with that degree, what is your, if you had the pie in the sky ""this is the job I want because I got this degree"", what would it be?"
A1,62.59032,67.73909,"Veteran: The simplistic answer for that, sir, is- is that I want to be in the position to where I can make decision."
A1,68.394905,75.17084,"Veteran: My career has been around- I""m a non comissioned officer, and I'm always assigned an officer or warrant officer to support. "
A1,76.143233,81.985289,"Veteran: And, being in a position similar to that of a CIO, that supports the entirety of the organization. "
A1,83.466495,98.100876,"Veteran: The information technology, track, allows the flexibility within IT, management, and any sub category in each area, to fill in that knowledge gap and support gap."
A1,98.586665,117.313814,"Veteran: At the end of the day, it's about making sure that, the overall boss is taken care of. And if the CIO position is that position, then that's what I'm working towards, and making sure the overall employer- he or she, whoever rates  or signs a paycheck, is taken care of on multiple facets."
Q2,118.321825,133.439395,"Interviewer: Ok, ok, cool, cool. Um, So, I noticed, and-and I'm just sort of correlating, uh, the job responsibilities to things in your resume, you know thye have the one that translates a vision into both long and short-term plans, uh-"
Q2,134.522874,146.153751,"Interviewer: And-and I noticed on your resume that you led a transformation from a singularly-focused, indepedent legacy solution to a cutting-edge, scalable, modular, integrated, uh, solution."
Q2,146.1818,149.086975,"Interviewer: Can you explain that, what that entailed, what you had to do for that?"
A2,150.104543,162.892927,"Veteran: Yes sir. Assigning from [inaudible], we actually lived from the Windows NT infrastructure 4.0, and we were the first domain to be selected for the active directory integration that would later become the Enterprise Network for DoD. "
A2,163.791636,169.438928,"Veteran: Currently, the structure is DoD Domain and sub-component services etc. etc. "
A2,170.969162,178.389582,"Veteran: There were, at that time, 27 Windows NT domains throughout the peninsula- on one network. "
A2,180.247723,200.213634,"Veteran: Our resonsibility was to engineer, design, and implement the actual directory structure that was put into place, to not only integrate all of those into one domain, but lso maintain the data, and in the information in the network flow, for that hirearchy, to make sure that nobody lost it."
A2,203.274102,204.020799,"Veteran: Say again sir?"
BCI,204.209245,205.074752,"Interviewer: No, go ahead, please."
BCI,205.144388,206.268117,"Interviewer: Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off."
A2,206.51674,213.099176,"Veteran: Oh no no no, sir. I-I apologize, I'm hard of hearing, I have uh,  uh, tennitus, uh, from being around field artillery-"
BCI,213.099176,219.266873,"Interviewer: I was going to say I noticed you had a lot to do with field artillery, so, yeah, uh, I noticed that, hahaha"
A2,220.082386,222.439885,"Veteran: Uh, as they say, ""pull string go boom"". "
BCI,222.608487,224.045909,"Interviewer: Yeah [laughs]"
BCI,224.068215,236.877371,"Interviewer: Exactly, yeah, and uh on top of that, yeah, you can, you-you don't have to call me ""sir"", it's all good. Um, I was actually, and actually I was at Gordon for a while, uh, while I was in, but long, long before your time I was in it, early 80s, so, uh-"
A2,237.736148,246.229956,"Veteran: Uh, speaking of Gordon, uh, I went through the 25 delta transition course at the school house over there, the same one that the chucks use"
BCI,246.618587,246.995073,"Interviewer: Yeah."
A2,247.068451,248.192032,"Veteran: With the, uh, [inaudible]"
A2,248.998951,261.277257,"Veteran: From there, I went three core at Fort Hood where integrated the core infrastructure network between the three major cores- 3 core, 5 core, that's currently reactiviating, and uh, first core."
A2,263.511885,273.409827,"Veteran: Couple of years ago, it was each core essentially had their own network segment. Not talking about the actual domain infrastructure, but the actual network engineering behind it for communications."
A2,274.357114,279.821781,"Veteran: Going into as much as I can go into right now, in this environment- I'm sure you understand, sir- "
BCI,280.538774,281.266087,"Interviewer: Absolutely."
A2,281.692522,300.225356,"Veteran: On the network engineering side, the focus has been driven to bring into a cloud infrastructure for the network environment so that we may integrate domain services and operations like sharepoint, exchange, so- to where it's not in one central location as a single point of failure."
A2,301.366959,321.660777,"Veteran: Over the last four or five years, even while being assigned in Germany, I still maintained, uh, my responsibilities for three core to integ- to see through that completion and make sure that at least on the primary network of concern, that the cloud infrastructure was put into place."
A2,321.709355,331.995251,"Veteran: And right now, as we speak, we're able to connect from Ft. Bragg, Ft. Gordon, Ft. Hood, Ft. Lewis. and some off-sites in Europe. "
Q3,333.538307,359.381304,"Interviewer: Very good, very good, cool cool cool. And so [coughs]I guess uh, as part of that, you're going cloud-based, uh so I guess you might be, uh, you talked about doing like, an AD, uh, uh, transform from Windows NT to AD with the one, uh one job, and probably having to deal with transforming, and-and uh, and doing that with your uh, with your new infrastructure, what you're working if they're the same, but um-"
Q3,360.438849,366.001128,"Interviewer: What-what-what-what type of, uh, budgetary constraints did you have to adhere to?"
A3,367.883559,392.7063,"Veteran: Primarily the job in Korea was limited based on licensing. We didn't have a KMS server for uh, bulk licensing at that time. Microsoft didn't even develop that until 2010, neighborhood. The budget at that time, for those server upgrades, was limited due to the fact we were able to basically salvage a couple of the uh, redundant, secondary Windows NT domain controllers."
A3,393.035262,412.47895,"Veteran: And turn them into uh, active directory domain controllers for primary assets across the node [inaudible]. With the AD structure, there's no primary and secondary domain controller anymore, it's just site to services based, so a lot of those secondary domain controllers that those 27 individual had, we were able to full integrate."
A3,412.503239,436.634787,"Veteran: So we go to domain 1, for uh, the MI batallion over there [inaudible], integrate them into the active directory structure- they would have 3 domain controllers there. We would leave one as their redundancy and then move the two over to the node center to provide one extra redundancy for the network segment and then one primary redundant for the actual main infrastructure. "
A3,437.533496,461.361425,"Veteran: And that was the rythym that we went through for the AD, the crossover. Budget- the actual number that went to it was 500 thousand. We undercut the budget for physical equipment by 25% based on the fact we were re-utilizing these servers since they met the requirements of processing, speed, network connectvitiy."
A3,462.162976,467.494506,"Veteran: Over at 3 core, our budget was in the neighborhood of- the unclassified  number was 7 million."
A3,468.988306,482.906148,"Veteran: The primary reason for that is because we had a server room already that was uh, refitted from a traditional pop network service for land-based lines, it was just restrucutred into a server room."
A3,483.756278,497.346213,"Veteran: A lot of the work was done in-house. I have an electrical background, so I contracted to DPW to have my apprenticeship license honored by them so that way I could actually go in on my off time and re-do some of the electrical. "
A3,498.439238,502.835624,"Veteran: This was all while I was taking soldiers through and saying, ""please don't touch that, that's a netural. "
BCI,503.066374,504.924515,"Interviewer: haha"
A3,505.398159,526.335646,"Veteran: So the primary concern is, yes we have a budget. But as always, I know that, especially with the department of defense, it's more of a number, but I don't see it that way because on the outside of the civilian sector, that number means something and if you can under- if you can come under the budget, it provides more financial asset reliability for the business overall"
A3,526.821435,530.768467,"Veteran: without compromising the actual integrity of the work and security of the infrastructure."
Q4,533.124542,549.823524,"Interviewer: Ok, ok. Uh, the reason why I ask, and I'm glad you explained it that way, is a lot of times uh, there's the notion, if you will, that, you know, within the military you get a budget, and if you don't use that budget, you lose the next time you ask for it, you don't get as much."
Q4,550.61293,557.754022,"Interviewer: So uh, I'm glad you explained it that well cause-cause a lot of times, you hear those kind of rumors and it's not quite true."
Q4,558.49485,593.034417,"Interviewer: So, uh, obviously working with the military, you have to worry about a lot of security and things like that. Going cloud-based is a little bit risky as far as the security model goes, and uh, in the civilian world, uh, you know there's benefits to going cloud but there's also, um, negatives to going cloud, uh, would you give me your opinion of what a civilian mode, say for a university, what the benefit to going to cloud or the negatives, you know can you give me the benefits of the pros and cons to going cloud or staying local?"
A4,593.678087,603.017372,"Veteran: Absolutely, sir. With any cloud-based infrastructure, there's always going to be that local element. There, there's always going to be different points of connection throughout the cloud-based network."
A4,603.818924,610.63482,"Veteran: Just because somebody connects and-and- that's outside the knowledge base of IT, they're able to connect to Google. "
A4,612.040895,632.699054,"Veteran: They don't necessarily see where that server is, but there's more than one location that does the load balancing across network and processing platforms. To bring that into the academic arena, you're allowing and expanding the capability of students and faculty to access work- work from home, especially during these last two years where we've had the onset of covid."
A4,633.196987,647.807079,"Veteran: So many people haven't been able to be next to each other. You and I are over Zoom right now. Through this cloud-based infrastructure we've been able to conduct this interview remotely, and still have nearly everything that we would have if we were in a physical connection right next to each other."
A4,648.827235,672.910203,"Veteran: However, we're using Zoom to conduct this meeting, which has had its fair share of security problems in the past, and that's where the cloud architect and the network designers and engineers of the network need to consider type 1, type 2 encryption, whether it be physical uh, encryption through, let's say, an IP set tunnel on the layer, uh tier 3 side of the networking"
A4,673.90607,689.171976,"Veteran: So where they have mass concentrators spread throughout their cloud structure, or, maybe a certificate authority on the backside of a couple of their domain controllers that are load balanced, so that way they can secure SSL and TLS [inaudible] motion."
A4,690.495749,699.276378,"Veteran: Just because we're able to connect right now and we see the lock doesn't necessarily mean that it's always secure. I know how to use wireshark and I can get into almost anything. "
BCI,699.458549,700.284389,"Interviewer: [laughs]"
A4,701.377413,717.67562,"Veteran: T-the- it's a constant monetary and defense-in-depth motion that ensures we are able to suffice and satisfy the security requirements and ensure reliability. "
A4,718.671487,736.123441,"Veteran: As long as the security measures put in place don't restrict the actual functions of what's require for that staff, that's where that [inaudible] balance come into play. If I put so many rules on the firewall, that doesn't allow Zoom, I'm restricting instead of enabling. "
A4,737.240755,754.498394,"Veteran: And that's a very delicate balance that has to be looked at. But at the same time, it's also education to the user on the network as well, too. Complex passwords, multiple forms of security measures, the three layers of security- who I am, what I am, what I know."
A4,755.263511,771.974638,"Veteran: Maybe the infrastructure has a common access card connection capability. Maybe they have- like Texas A&M right now uses, uh, Duo, in order to verify that person's actually logging in with who they say- who they say they are."
A4,772.472571,781.593251,"Veteran: They put in their username, password, Duo sends a confirmation on your phone, you have two factors of indent- uh, of security indentification right there that helps at that input."
A4,783.354235,796.555539,"Veteran: But it's, again,  it's that delicate of maintaining infofrmation security, being able to monitor for anything outside mailicious, and also enabling the user to perform all of their functions with ease. "
Q5,797.332801,846.446026,"Interviewer: Ok, cool. [coughs] Excuse me. So, let's say that uh, that you're hired into a position that's in charge of the uh, uh, IT for the, for uh, an entire organization. Pick an organization, non military organization. And, and they say, ""you know, we've got stuff in place, we've got servers, we've got, you know, our people can do the work, you know mostly they just uh, you know, can access uh, you know they've got local on their machine, they've got Word, and the Microsoft suite of tools, and-and uh, you know bu-but we have, you know, say, 5000 people in our company, and uh, you know we have all of our local servers and everything we're doing, we've got our local active directory, uh, you know but-but we're looking at, you know, we hear about the cloud thing."""
Q5,846.591762,875.18042,"Interviewer: ""We hear about it. You know, so, we know there's like a thing called 'AWS,There's something called 'Azure', there's all these different buzzwords, um, a-a-a-and we just want help knowing, you know, are we where we need to be, and, and i-if, a-and if we are fine, but if not, uh, where do we need to go so, we're asking you, you know, those questions, and what do you need from us to be able to answer those questions?"""
A5,875.787655,896.773722,"Veteran: First and foremost, it would be enough time to make the initial assessment. Based off your requirements that you just listed, coming into the position I would ask for at least a minimum of fifteen days to be able to make a proper assessment of what is currently on the books, physically for equipement, the requirements the users have, and budgetary options as well, too."
A5,897.2838,919.508627,"Veteran: It may be that everything's working fine right now, but, moving over to AWS for example, may relieve the company of the financial burden that just doesn't need to be there. If the security meausures meet, and the capabilities meet, during that assessment period when the report's brought back over to the CEO or CFO,"
A5,920.249454,936.329056,"Veteran: A case could be made either way, whether we need to stay internally or develop our own cloud, or if we need to move to a preexisting infrastructure that supports cloud based technologies for the users overall. The primary concern that I would like to uh, point out, though, is information ownership."
A5,936.863423,958.517449,"Veteran: Understanding that if we go to a cloud-based infrastructure that is owned by Amazon, or AWS for example, that we have to un- uh, play by their rules essentially, and understand where, exactly is that information being store at on that cloud, and that's more of a information security and information ownership understanding between the CIO and CEO."
A5,959.428303,979.831423,"Veteran: If we own the cloud, and we own our own structure and we separate out- we own the information, so there's and intrusion for example, we don't have to go through a third party to get that information. But it's a-a- I go back to balance, because it's a balance between budget, capabilites, reliability, and security."
A5,980.183619,1004.78881,"Veteran: And that assessment period, after coming in, taking into account all of the questions you just aksed, being able to go through all the equipment, all the books, and all the personnel and matching their strengths to what can, what needs to be accomplished, can present, uh-can complete that report and find a way forward that's accessible by the entire organization."
Q6,1007.922147,1027.232242,"Interviewer: And uh, so, if we're installing new equipment, and you know, we have our own folks that [inaudible], the IT folks that, that work for you, and they're installing equipment and we have some other folks who come in and install the software and then they're going to do their validation, their testing and make sure it all works well"
Q6,1028.082372,1050.768699,"Interviewer: And uh, and-and uh, you know the-the-the validate, the people doing the testing, the validation say ""well you know, this-this isn't right, this isnt' installed right, uh, you know it's missing some things that we have in the spec, but the people that installed it say 'well no, it's, it-it's the way it's supposed to be that was in the spec', that's the way it's supposed to be"""
Q6,1051.533816,1060.192997,"Interviewer: You go back to the validators and you're like ""no no no, these things are missing"" so there's that difference of opinion, how do you arbitrate a system, or a challenge like that?"
A6,1062.354756,1067.625562,"Veteran: Simply put, that's conflict resolution but that's also based on the contract that was put into place from the beginning"
A6,1068.755021,1086.243409,"Veteran: If the employees in the organization maintains a proper oversight of the installation process throughout the installation period, this a-alleviates some of the flaws that we would have with the installation to kinda cut this off at the pass, if you will, before we get to this point."
A6,1086.8385,1099.541871,"Veteran: Active engagement. Not just with the employees, but also making sure that the in- the equipment the company physically bought, there's a vested interest from the personnel responsible to make sure their ownership is improving that as well."
A6,1100.367712,1110.885034,"Veteran: If they're not maintaining proper oversight throughout the course of installation, that's where it, this-this impasse we're at becomes a conflict that doesn't need to be."
A6,1112.245242,1131.227431,"Veteran: But we're at where we're at right now because that's what happened, and so the way we move forward is we have our original contract, we have our original requirements that we all agreed to from the very beginning, and we just simply arbitrate- sit down and say ""this is where we need to go, this is what we need to get here. How do we fix this wrong?"
A6,1131.239576,1134.530793,"Veteran: We don't need to present a problem without a solution."
Q7,1134.530793,1169.701886,"Interviewer: So, during that discussion, and-and let's just say that in this uh, this scenario, that-that the people that sold it, whoever was doing the installation, whether they were, you know, uh, whehter they were in the same company or whether they were third-party, uh they say ""yep, you're right, uh, yep, we- the contract said we were supposed to install this but didn't, and uh-uh so we're going to fix that, but it's going to take us this- you know, and then ,obviously it was in the contract, so no extra cost to you. However, it's gonna extend our schedule by about 15 days, 15 working days."" "
Q7,1170.187674,1178.458225,"Interviewer: Um, which you look at your overall schedule, and you say ""yep that's a day-for-day slip up, overall schedule is going to slip me by 15 days, what do you do with that information?"
A7,1179.393368,1198.776332,"Veteran: That's where we get with everybody, collectively, in-house and say ""look, we have an additional 15 days of work that needs to be completed on this equipment, moving forward, from now, to cover these 15 days, what can we do internally to make sure these operations move as smooth as possible for the end user with the equipment that we have currently?"""
A7,1199.456436,1208.759287,"Veteran: Just because an additional 15 days is needed to work on something doesn't necessarily mean that we have to take care of  it [inaudible]. While we may be running limited capacity, it is some capacity."
A7,1209.755153,1230.559049,"Veteran: So I would encourage, as the CIO in this position, to bring in the engineers and say ""Look, we have to maintain operations, this is not something we can just stop working on.There has to be a way forward in this, because every moment that we lose without the ability to process any information, that's money lost to the organization overall. "
Q8,1233.874556,1238.671718,"Interviewer: Cool,  oh yes, yes sir. Um, so um, "
Q8,1241.97508,1252.711008,"Interviewer: High level question, just a generic, as high level, so feel free to answer any way you want, it-it's a-another scenario, but how do you stop a ddos attack?"
Q8,1257.010237,1262.548226,"Interviewer: Ddos, yeah, how do you stop a d- how do you make sure your, y-your low risk for a ddos attack? "
A8,1262.778976,1263.568382,"Veteran: White listing. "
A8,1264.30921,1275.470202,"Veteran: Simply put, white listing. Everything in the organ-organization should be accounted for. On the military side we have uh, an L-dif, now I'm not referring to the same L-dif that's in active directory."
A8,1276.381056,1290.481069,"Veteran: Each unit, uh that is uh, issued their server stack for their mission command processing, also comes with a disk full of ""these are your IPs. This is everything you're gonna have. This is also everybody else that's on the entirety of the network."""
A8,1290.808977,1304.204596,"Veteran: It's a network engineer and s- uh, and network operations support is properly annotating every connection that is required- and we're talking about services, like let's say, employees use Google mail. That should be on the white list."
A8,1304.666096,1318.401767,"Veteran: Servers, uh, employees should be able to go to Google mail. Employees should be able to go internally. But there should also be a white listing that that takes place not only on the outside perimeter of the network, but also on the DMZ firewall, and the internal firewall."
A8,1318.887556,1331.991703,"Veteran: There should be a no-reciprocation policy for uh, I'm sorry, uh, class A, the [inaudible] network, 1-9-2 dot 1-6-8-1-7-2 dot 1-6-"
A8,1332.08886,1337.141062,"Veteran: Those IP's should not be allowed inside the network. That's known, because they're not routable."
A8,1338.015481,1350.281642,"Veteran: If we know that we have a c-uh, central point of connection to the outside of one central location, we should know what's going in and out on a daily basis, we could use passive network monitoring that's offered from services like like ACAS."
A8,1351.581127,1353.123506,"Veteran: Excuse me one second [coughs]"
A8,1354.155806,1355.758909,"Veteran: I just recovered from a cold, I'm sorry [laughs]"
BCI,1355.831777,1357.264853,"Interviewer: No worries, no worries"
A8,1358.382167,1360.762531,"Veteran: But it comes down to ""do you know your network""."
A8,1361.940568,1379.744719,"Veteran: And if you know your network, and you know that all of the information's that being trafficked across both in and out, and you're properly monitoring and annotating everything when it occurs, you should have a 99.99959 idea of where you're at on your infrastructure."
A8,1380.412679,1400.257142,"Veteran: There should be no surprises at this point. So let's say, for a common ddos attack you're seeing a lot of traffic. Ra-random places, it's coming through one or two of your outside connections, your perimeter firewall should be able to have enough processing power to stop that."
A8,1400.585049,1421.109616,"Veteran: A prime example of this, and this is just my best guess- because I haven't been briefed on this yet- the Facebook issue that happened a few days ago, that was a ddos attack. But not only was a it a ddos attack externally, they through the articles I read, apparently the firewalls they were using not ASA firewalls by Cisco."
A8,1421.486102,1427.060526,"Veteran: Because it went into a failed open state, and that's a known problem through boundary."
A8,1428.396445,1437.262086,"Veteran: I'm not saying boundary's bad, I'm saying that boundary has been known to go into that failed open state and there are ways to fix that through additional processing."
A8,1438.804465,1457.276575,"Veteran: If you're familiar with your equipment, you should know, and you should also pin-test internally. White box, grey box, black box, however you want to do it, test yourself. Have a sandbox on side with some similar equipment, if you can. If not, virtual machine is your friend. Oracle box is your friend."
A8,1459.644795,1477.011736,"Veteran: But the way I equate this to uh, both civilians and soldiers, is, is that you have to understand your vectors of attack. If you live in a house, every window, every door, is a possible threat. One person, coming to the door, trying to pick your lock, is a DOS. "
A8,1477.934734,1484.031381,"Veteran: Ten people come to your house, and one goes to each door, each window that you have, that-that's a distributed DOS. "
A8,1484.881511,1499.540181,"Veteran: And if we do what we can do white list, ""Hey! That guy's not supposed to be at that window. Hey! That guy's not supposed to be at that door."" We know what's going on, that's a white list. But we see one of our family members come to the house, let em on in, because we know."
A8,1500.815376,1526.987235,"Veteran: But if we have so many people rushing the front door, and the door falls over, we're in a failed open state. We should be able to fix that door to where, if so many people rush it, it stays locked, until fail close. Because I would rather have internal network capabilities on a fail close and no external capabilities than have that distributed DOS, that hit Facebook a couple days ago, go inside and ruin the authentication system for their access badges for the building."
A8,1528.408167,1547.63325,"Veteran: So, this is where constant education, constant training, constant engagement from oversight and management to make sure that the employees understand these are the f- the major security risks and concerns that we have to take part in defending."
Q9,1549.212062,1553.912067,"Interviewer: They did have some pretty-tightly coupled systems there, didn't they [laughter] Oh my God. "
BCV,1554.021369,1562.376933,"Veteran: If you read the articles, and you knew what to pick up on, you'd [inaudible], and I'm pretty sure you saw it and kinda shook your head, had a little bit of grief there"
Q9,1562.583393,1586.50848,"Interviewer: Yeah, exactly, it's ok to be cohesive, but don't=don't be that coupled and yeah- just have that, that challenge, that's pretty bad. So um, yeah, we went into something a little bit different, and I noticed you did a lot of training, you're in a lot of training, uh, you know, handling, uh groups of uh, you know training for some of the uh, the-the in-the national defense operations and stuff like that, so, uh-"
Q9,1587.261452,1600.936401,"Interviewer: If you are, uh, in charge of a company's IT, a university, pick it- a university might be a little bit different, but um, you know, tell me what your internal training strategy would be. "
Q9,1603.632527,1605.199195,"Interviewer: For your employees, for your employees. "
A9,1606.146483,1625.675184,"Veteran: Yes sir, it-it's a layered approach. You have to understand where your employees are at currently. That's not necessarily an official assessment, you have to get with- you have to be with them, to understand what there strengths and weaknesses are, and you start working off of that. If you're working, or traning development inside a network operations center,"
A9,1626.197406,1642.119127,"Veteran: You need to look across the board and say ""OK, where are we at as far as certifications, where are we at as far as formal education goes. What's our baseline of understanding."" And once we get that average baseline of assessment, throughout that section, then we can start moving forward."
A9,1642.362021,1654.154539,"Veteran: Yes, individuals will need individualized training for advancement because even if they're planning on working there for only a year, we shouldn't treat employees like they're-"
A9,1654.871077,1661.028447,"Veteran: W-we shouldn't restrict training opportunities from them just because we don't think they're gonna be there that long."
A9,1661.878577,1669.918378,"Veteran: That training opportunity may be what turns them into the most model employee and worker out of that entire workforce. "
A9,1670.513469,1675.687117,"Veteran: That one class could keep them there for the rest of their career and be an asset to the company. "
A9,1677.101601,1701.046971,"Veteran: But to focus on their areas, we also have to include the separtion of duries too. So I am not  keep one employee network administrator a tier 2 assetemployee, entire time they were there. That level of training is more in the line of CCNA, At some point I am going to advance that employee more of a CCNP role"
A9,1701.9169,1715.233515,"Veteran: Now they have a tier 3. In addition I am going to get them the opportunity to take what I have pushed them to learn, put them in the exact same situation, so they may teach the tier 2, who took over their role"
A9,1716.104726,1719.468812,"Veteran: And so on, and so on, so on so on. That's where the triple effect comes into play."
A9,1720.646849,1732.135749,"Veteran: Do the employees have the right certifications and education? What can we do to bridge that gapof knowledge not just for that one, singular employee, but for the overall organization?"
A9,1732.9373,1745.640671,"Veteran: There are many different routes in IT for that one individual to gain the knowledge to be able to do the work. Many, just because the organization took the time and effort to be able to take interest in that one individual."
Q10,1748.47039,1758.64766,"Interviewer: Very good. Um, yeah that-that's a great answer, I mean that's uh, that's spot-on for-for the way my company does it anyway. We really believe in that focus on our employees that same way."
Q10,1759.461356,1770.075836,"Interviewer: You know, you get rid of single points of failure, gives people room for advancement, that's great. Um, and I noticed I think I read here, I'm pretty sure I don't see it right now but your uh, PMP certified, right?"
BCV,1770.488757,1770.950256,"Veteran: Yes sir. "
Q10,1771.095992,1774.411499,"Interviewer: So a little side question, what do you know about Agile?"
A10,1776.136049,1788.499368,"Veteran: I know it follows similar to the pin box guide for PMP. If you take PMP and follow it step-by-step all the way through, and add in a little bit of flexibility, you have Agile. "
BCI,1788.924433,1789.628826,"Interviewer: [laughter]"
A10,1790.819008,1807.12936,"Veteran: I've read, I-I-I've read their uh, primary development book for their certification track, I don't see to many differences between PMP and Agile other than there's a lot of encouragement for thinking outside the box and providing problem and solution assets. "
A10,1807.663727,1813.675361,"Veteran: PMP is more of a step-by-step, things will happen this way because they normally happen this way."
A10,1813.784663,1816.711539,"Veteran: The test is very straightforward, the learning material is very straightforward."
A10,1817.294486,1828.115426,"Veteran: I had been working on Agile, I've been kinda sidetracked with classes here as of late, I just got through my uh, uh preliminaries, and I'm not gonna lie that kinda took priority."
BCI,1828.455478,1830.510341,"Interviewer: Oh, no doubt. Right? [laughter]"
A10,1831.455222,1839.968667,"Veteran: Agile, I love the concept. It's actually taught in the NCOES uh, noncomissioned officer education system at this point, along with [inaudible]"
BCI,1840.915955,1841.292441,"Interviewer: Ok."
A10,1841.292441,1855.125271,"Veteran: Those management styles mold and prepare noncomissioned officers and other leaders, along with civilian employees in the civilian sector, to understand sometimes, things break."
A10,1855.526046,1864.695305,"Veteran: Sometimes, things just happen. And we have to be able to take the traditional skills, PMP, and apply them in an agile manner to be able to"
A10,1866.128382,1870.464045,"Veteran: Come together and think of the problem and a solution on the spot."
BCI,1870.767663,1898.967689,"Interviewer: Right, right. And and I kn-know you-you're like you said super busy, but it seems like you-you put a lot of irons in the fire given, given your industry here, so um, so at one point in time it might be good to take like an Agile class uh, either a- just an Agile immersion class or something like that uh, you know, Agile [inaudible] especially if you're gonna be managing people that are doing Agile, um it's less of a waterfall and more of in-incremental type process."
BCI,1899.659938,1902.959863,"Interviewer: Um, and uh, yeah, it really is"
