Q1,0.07425,0.818,"Interviewer: Hello. "
BCV,1.427875,1.91875,"Veteran: Howdy."
BCV,3.599625,8.58275,"Veteran: Well, I am here to give you an interview for a GIS analysis position."
Q1,9.267,17.730875,"Interviewer: Um, and I see that uh, some of the requirements here are, that uh, you need to collect global positioning system data."
Q1,17.939125,26.1055,"Interviewer: GPS data. And then I assume, convert that into GIS format. Can you tell me about any experience that you've had with that? "
A1,27.20625,34.40575,"Veteran: Yes sir. Ok, so right now, for my uh, research project, I'm a research assistant, and essentially I'm doing just that."
A1,35.06025,37.2915,"Veteran: What we do, is we're taking uh-"
A1,38.407125,44.52075,"Veteran: We're taking- I'm taking [inaudible] files off a [inaudible], which is a tech [inaudible] resource uh, information systems website."
A1,45.23475,49.45925,"Veteran: And our focus is the Brazos River, because we're trying to better understand flooding."
A1,49.965,54.33825,"Veteran: So right now, one of my biggest uh, things that I do, is I collect just uh, rasters"
A1,55.096875,61.998875,"Veteran: And I'm collecting this data and then using GIS or PIS- I'm digitizing river scrolls, which is-"
A1,62.415375,64.914375,"Veteran: Essentially, I'm digitizing the river itself."
A1,65.687875,67.621625,"Veteran: And what we're doing is we're looking at river scrolls, which are essentially-"
A1,70.34375,71.429625,"Veteran: uh-"
A1,71.875875,81.128125,"Veteran: It's kind of like scarification of the land geomorphology, and winter as river bends and meanders, it creates, um, an imprint on the earth."
A1,82.214,90.499375,"Veteran: And that, in essence, is gonna give us a better understanding of how the, uh, historically, how the river has meandered and moved and bent. So-"
A1,91.5555,102.17625,"Veteran: To more focus on your question, is that what essentially, what I'm trying to describe is exactly what we mentioned. And yes, I'm pretty familiar with digitization, and that's what I'm doing-"
A1,102.83075,103.916625,"Veteran: And that's where I'm at."
Q2,105.433875,106.81725,"Interviewer: Ok. Um-"
Q2,108.00725,113.853125,"Interviewer: Looking here, I- I don't see that you have any experience with CAD, uh, do you have any of this not listed on your resume?"
A2,115.32575,117.52725,"Veteran: No, I do not have-"
A2,118.166875,121.63275,"Veteran: much experience with CAD. Uh, computer-aided drafting. "
A2,122.46575,125.14325,"Veteran: Um, however, that's because-"
A2,126.86875,129.233875,"Veteran: Essentially, I-I'm a geographer."
A2,130.096625,131.970875,"Veteran: And I was minoring in GIS."
A2,132.863375,137.325875,"Veteran: And while CAD- I think-"
A2,139.18525,140.776875,"Veteran: It's um, it's-"
A2,141.847875,145.060875,"Veteran: Our CAD courses are more in line with uh-engineers-"
A2,145.834375,153.10825,"Veteran: However, that does not mean I am not interested, and I- whatever skills it takes is really what I'm- anything, whatever it takes."
A2,153.331375,157.422,"Veteran: So really- so you- if, if you guys need CAD, I'll pick it up."
Q3,158.612,164.874375,"Interviewer: Ok, good. Um, let's see. Obviously done cartography, GIS collection, um-"
Q3,168.831125,173.011,"Interviewer: [inaudible] computing programming techniques and languages, oh good. I'm gonna jump on that one."
Q3,173.10025,183.721,"Interviewer: Um, so it looks like there is some programming needed for this job, uh, can you tell me about some of your experiences programming, what languages you're familiar with, any projects you've completed?"
A3,184.866375,193.434375,"Veteran: Ok, early on, whenever I was uh, first trying to decide what I wanted to do, I went into a little bit- into uh, network management, and that- "
A3,194.059125,197.420875,"Veteran: I started doing html 5-"
A3,198.313375,203.56425,"Veteran: However, um, I decided that wasn't necessarily my, uh, what I really wanted to do,"
A3,204.04025,206.3905,"Veteran: However, so I am familiar with html 5-"
A3,207.2235,215.018,"Veteran: I'm mostly familiar with Python, SQL, however I can't tell you that I'm an expert or that I'm really confident."
A3,215.5535,222.232375,"Veteran: However, I am familiar with it. With- and so, in my education experience, I do have Python-"
A3,222.738125,224.969375,"Veteran: And um, C Sharp."
A3,226.204,235.441375,"Veteran: However, again, it's one of those technical skills that uh, whatever's necessary, I'm more than willing to pick up. I'm really- I'm a hands-on learner-"
A3,236.274375,240.09725,"Veteran: And so, whenever I need a- the experiences that I have-"
A3,240.915375,244.768,"Veteran: In school have been very basic. Essentially we follow a recepie. "
A3,245.764625,252.0865,"Veteran: However, I'm really much- I'm very ready to get into industry, to go hands-on, and to learn- truly learn-"
A3,253.380625,256.504375,"Veteran: these languages, and put them into- and apply them properly."
Q4,258.348875,266.902,"Interviewer: Yeah yeah, that is something we definitely get from uh, the associates who come here to Improving it's like- there-there's a difference between the theory taught in school, and what they actually experience."
Q4,267.482125,274.413875,"Interviewer: Um, uh, one thing I wanted to ask you about, because I saw this on your resume, and it was interesting- what is a master driver?"
A4,275.633625,279.0995,"Veteran: Ok, a master driver is a- it's a position made up by Pizza Hut."
A4,279.4565,283.05625,"Veteran: Essentially, I was a- I was in charge of all the drivers-"
A4,283.8,288.17325,"Veteran: And so, they call it a master driver, which is essentially-"
A4,288.917,297.485,"Veteran: I'd go out and teach the uh, new incoming drivers, the prop- the Pizza Hut way of being a proper driver, and um-"
A4,297.975875,304.387,"Veteran: I guess I do have some real experience [inaudible] driving, but also driving on operations over in Afghanistan."
A4,304.639875,312.717,"Veteran: [inaudible], that was one of my first jobs, the driver, I drove humvees, I learned everything about humvees, and proper maintenance- "
A4,313.22275,320.18425,"Veteran: And drove hours and hours along the Afghan-Pakistan border, so I have plenty experience driving."
A4,320.66025,327.517625,"Veteran: And then whenever I applied it to a civilian job, I quickly moved up as the Pizza Hut delivery driver, to the so-called Master Driver."
A4,328.1275,328.975375,"Veteran: And that's what I meant."
Q5,330.00175,336.4575,"Interviewer: So then obviously you have uh, some exerience in leading a team, and working with others. Can you tell me some good stories?"
A5,336.90375,341.767875,"Veteran: Absolutely. Well, um, ok. For leadership-"
A5,343.880125,347.91125,"Veteran: I automatically go to Afghanistan. One of my first things that I did as a leader-"
A5,348.580625,357.78825,"Veteran: or, my first day on the job was one of my soldiers- brand new, comes in, first day in Afghanistan, and he tells me-"
A5,358.160125,360.079,"Veteran: ""Hey Rod"" Rodriguez, Rod-"
A5,361.269,362.578,"Veteran: ""I have a problem at home""."
A5,363.26225,366.014125,"Veteran: And essentially, he had been married for a whole week-"
A5,367.219,377.378625,"Veteran: And then he deployed, and by the time we got to Afghanistan, his wife had already cheated on him and was trying to get the deeds of his motorcycle and car-"
A5,377.676125,385.678875,"Veteran: to sell them. And so it's literally trial by fire, I'm in Afghanistan, I'm trying to figure out ""what do I do""."
A5,386.333375,394.589,"Veteran: And essentially, we walked over to the uh, to the uh, S1 shop, which is like a admin-"
A5,395.09475,399.810125,"Veteran: And I had to sit there, and we had to figure it out, everything we had to figure out- legal, what to do-"
A5,400.226625,402.324,"Veteran: And that was my first day one, on the job in Afghanistan."
A5,404.49575,412.900125,"Veteran: Then later on, whenever in combat operations, I went from a door kicker part of the team- one of the first guys inside the building-"
A5,413.5695,420.769,"Veteran: to leading the team. I've been a front lead and a whole um, company size element manuevers, which is about-"
A5,421.319375,428.53375,"Veteran: 300 men. And I was a pointman- and talk about pressure. That's probably the most pressure- besides when bullets are flying over your head."
A5,429.708875,434.60275,"Veteran: Being the lead guy, being in charge, and making sure that you're going in the right way-"
A5,435.272125,443.40875,"Veteran: But at the same time, i-it's leadership. It- because I have to uh, I had to lead, literally lead- be the point guy-"
A5,443.542625,449.35875,"Veteran: in front of huge wedge formation, point of the spear, going into combat operations."
BCI,449.8645,452.973375,"Interviewer: Yeah, that- that's always stressful on a two-way range."
A5,453.88075,454.936875,"Veteran: Yeah, absolutely."
Q6,456.216125,460.12825,"Interviewer: Um, let's see. How else can I pull out of this one?"
Q6,461.13975,469.454875,"Interviewer: Um, oh, here's one you might be getting on- asked about. Uh, command post of the future operator. Sounds like a very interesting job."
Q6,469.901125,472.608375,"Interviewer: Can you uh, give me a little more details about what it is?"
A6,473.292625,478.885625,"Veteran: Yes sir. Essentially that's the military application of GIS. And that is actually how I got into GIS."
A6,479.4955,483.377875,"Veteran: As mentioned before, I was a pointman, I was an infantryman really. "
A6,484.04725,493.002,"Veteran: That was my job. However, I went through an interview process,and from one day to the next, I became the brigade commanders of PSE- personal security detatchment [inaudible]."
A6,493.641625,501.079125,"Veteran: So, essentially, I went from the bullet catcher- very bottom- to the very top, and it's a complete paradigm shift."
A6,501.451,507.66875,"Veteran: Seeing things from-from the very bottom, you need boots on ground, to seeing things from the very top from a bird's eye perspective."
A6,508.02575,512.25025,"Veteran: So the CPOF, the command post of the future, is command and control software-"
A6,512.770875,517.292875,"Veteran: Essentially, it's GIS with military applications. Every vehicle, and um-"
A6,517.992,524.32875,"Veteran: and also some people would carry transponders, were icons, and we would track their manuevers in our battlespace."
A6,524.8345,527.512,"Veteran: So my job was to, not only uh-"
A6,528.538375,533.090125,"Veteran: Litterally set up the whole- the system, with the help of our communications guys."
A6,533.357875,539.783875,"Veteran: I literally set up the tent, set up the uh, command post, set up the computer system, and then I ran the uh-"
A6,540.21525,547.6825,"Veteran: Where I help operate the system, which again, is command and control software tracking where the good guys are, tracking where the bad guys are."
A6,547.89075,552.41275,"Veteran: Um, making data every significant activity, sigac-"
A6,553.052375,559.894875,"Veteran: And just uh, kinda like keeping track of people. Cause that's really, that's the picture that the commanders have in the battlespace, and that's how they make their decisions."
BCI,561.382375,563.345875,"Interviewer: That is some very cool tech."
A6,563.8665,566.8415,"Veteran: Yeah, it-it was, it was eye-opening."
A6,566.8415,571.57175,"Veteran: Like I mentioned, it's- it was a complete change of perspective, seeing it-"
A6,571.80975,576.525125,"Veteran: Instead of being, uh, stuck in a village, now I was seeing the whole picture."
A6,576.897,580.824,"Veteran: And I was helping you know, keep track, make uh-"
A6,581.4785,592.381875,"Veteran: Essentially, reporting everything, making sure everything was uh, working the right way, and of course, I wasn't the only one who would fix it whenever things went astray, I would, you know, have support."
A6,592.75375,597.112125,"Veteran: But my job was to make sure, you know, everything was fine and report everything."
Q7,601.604375,605.1,"Interviewer: What was that other thing I saw? Um...."
Q7,608.179125,617.1785,"Interviewer: Ok, here we go. Um, uh, requirement here is uh, using environmental systems to research institute products. Do you have any experience with those products?"
A7,617.937125,618.4875,"Veteran: [inaudible]"
A7,618.8445,628.6025,"Veteran: Yes sir. Our GIS, and uh, our map, essentially, as a geographer, I started off with a minor in GIS, so I am fairly familiar- "
A7,629.40575,636.48625,"Veteran: However, like I mentioned before, at school- and I hope my grades reflect this- um-"
A7,637.468,647.73175,"Veteran: It's, it's kinda like- it's a- it's a lot. It's a crash course, and especially with the full course- courseload, but often it's very much follow a recepie."
A7,648.535,654.87175,"Veteran: You know, at the very end, yes they give you one last project- a senior project, or you know, the final class project-"
A7,654.87175,660.1375,"Veteran: And that's the only time where, you know, you get a little bit of hands on- use-use your skills that you learned. "
A7,660.806875,667.575,"Veteran: But really, uh, what I was doing was I was following the recepie, try to make the grade, and so yes."
A7,667.575,671.516875,"Veteran: I am familiar with [inaudible], and it's generally the main system that I was using. "
A7,672.00775,676.663625,"Veteran: However, I- like I said, I'm ready to jump in industry, I'm ready to learn more."
Q8,677.452,686.46625,"Interviewer: Cool, I-I was not familiar with that, so that's maybe something they wouldn't ask us, they would see the [inaudible] and know that's an S3 product."
Q8,686.629875,694.930125,"Interviewer: Um, ok, about this time, towards the end of the interview, I generally like to ask people ""tell me about yourself"", ""what are your hobbies"", ""what do you like to do""."
A8,697.23575,702.6205,"Veteran: My hobbies. Well, I'd say I'm a- I've been told I'm very creative."
A8,703.54275,710.9505,"Veteran: I like art, I enjoy reading, I like playing guitar. Um, I like toiling, if I had a superpower-"
A8,711.15875,714.832875,"Veteran: it would- I'd break things. I'm a pro at breaking stuff."
A8,715.20475,721.125,"Veteran: However, i-it's in my nature to be a tinkerer, to fix things, to learn how things work."
A8,721.5415,728.86,"Veteran: I just have- I'm fairly- I have a pretty um, eclectic range of things that I like."
A8,729.0385,732.51925,"Veteran: And so, I like to tinker, I like to think, I like to imagine."
A8,733.144,737.9635,"Veteran: And- and so I like, also, creating stuff, I like uh, playing guitar, making music."
A8,738.335375,740.07575,"Veteran: I enjoy playing chess."
A8,740.715375,745.78775,"Veteran: Um, man I like mechanical stuff. I like cars, I like motorcycles."
A8,746.0555,750.384125,"Veteran: I ride a motorcycle. I always work on my Mustang, there's always something broken on a Ford."
A8,750.756,752.407125,"Veteran: [chuckling] Yeah."
A8,752.645125,761.748625,"Veteran: So uh, yeah, that's what I do, um, besides- I'm also part of um, a fraternity, but we're a Latino-based fraternity."
A8,762.18,767.996125,"Veteran: So I mean, I do have a passion for helping people who kinda look like myself."
A8,768.10025,770.4505,"Veteran: Because growing up in rural Oklahoma-"
A8,771.357875,775.8055,"Veteran: We didn't have um, I didn't have that many uh, people to look up to."
A8,776.31125,781.115875,"Veteran: You know, over there, the job was to- you end up in a meatpacking, processing plant-"
A8,781.60675,785.3255,"Veteran: And so, I want to be that guy who other people look up to."
A8,785.548625,793.12,"Veteran: Because you know, it's not that we can't, it's that the opportunities aren't there.And if you- if another kid who looks like me-"
A8,793.759625,798.400625,"Veteran: if I give him that chance, that belief in himself, I'm more than sure, and you know, and-"
A8,798.787375,805.82325,"Veteran: And so I have a passion for helping, uh, the Latino cause, and also any minority- or anyone in general-"
A8,806.35875,811.327,"Veteran: And so yeah- I definitely have passion for helping people, because if I can do it, they can do it."
A8,811.847625,814.673875,"Veteran: You know, that-that's me."
IRR,815.93825,822.498125,"Interviewer: And then you generally- the last question you'll get in an interview, in any interview, is uh, is there anything you'd like to know about the company? "
IRR,823.25675,835.201375,"Interviewer: Um, cause remem- one thing to remember, cause I'm sure you haven't job hunted a lot- is it works both ways. Not only is the interviewer looking to see if you're a good fit for the company, you should be looking at the company to see if they're a good fit for you."
IRR,837.507,844.542875,"Veteran: I'd like more information as to uh, how does GIS work with the company, how-how does that integrate."
IRR,847.8005,853.9885,"Interviewer: Ok, something along those lines would be a question I- I don't know, cause I'm not an actual member of the company um-"
IRR,855.80325,860.14675,"Interviewer: Mm-kay, so you'd ask more about some of the technical sides of it and how it works? Ok, cool."
IRR,860.50375,867.16775,"Veteran: Essentially, I'm-I'm- I would like to get a better grasp because it- like I mentioned, my weak points, I feel, is experience. "
IRR,867.866875,870.663375,"Veteran: And I'm trying to gauge, how am I gonna um- "
IRR,871.03525,876.0035,"Veteran: How can I better my technical expertise to better suit the company itself."
IRR,876.56875,882.22125,"Veteran: And I guess I didn't word it well enough, but that is my general- that's the idea behind that question."
IRR,882.39975,883.604625,"Interviewer: The kind of things you'd ask, ok. Cool."
IRR,884.675625,894.77575,"Interviewer: Alright, uh, well, that concludes this part of it, so thank you very much, uh, go grab the researcher and let him know, and uh, the resume looks really good-"
IRR,894.77575,902.8975,"Interviewer: I-I like how you've laid the things out. Um, because you got your relevant [inaudible] for here's the things that will be applicable to this type of job, right at the top."
IRR,903.507375,914.038875,"Interviewer: Uh, you got good listing of skills, also high up. And, I-I- coming from a computing background, is like skills, and applicable stuff is- is actually more important than your work history."
IRR,914.128125,921.535875,"Interviewer: Work history is a bonus, but you have to have the particular skills to know that ""hey, when we start, you'll be successful"". At least enough to, you know- "
IRR,922.279625,927.188375,"Interviewer: That whatever else you've done for some other company can be applicable to us."
IRR,930.089,930.877375,"Interviewer: Eehh"
IRR,931.54675,939.57925,"Interviewer: But it's-it's-it's uh, no- the master driver is just like, to me, that was just one of those- I have never heard of a master driver, I have to ask that question. "
IRR,940.099875,943.521125,"Veteran: Hahaha"
IRR,944.562375,949.129,"Interviewer: Yeah b-b-that's-that's job history, which is fine to have on there. Um-"
IRR,950.095875,962.695,"Interviewer: I'm-I'm well experienced in my field, so like- all of my resume is definitely work-related. But as someone who's newer in the field, yeah- you're gonna have unrelated jobs and we expect that all the time when we're hiring entry-level people."
IRR,963.007375,970.22175,"Interviewer: It's just that yes, you have worked a job before, yes you know how to keep a schedule, yes you know how to work on a team, yes you know how to not piss off a manager, type of stuff."
IRR,970.831625,975.69575,"Interviewer: You know, but you've kept this job for over a year, so you're doing good. Um-"
IRR,976.424625,980.87225,"Interviewer: But yeah. So that's about all the feedback I can give you right now."
IRR,982.136625,984.353,"Veteran: Alrighty, well thank you sir, I really appreciate your time."
