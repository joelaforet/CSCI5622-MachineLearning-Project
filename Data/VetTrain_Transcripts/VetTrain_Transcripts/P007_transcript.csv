A2,182.795566,249.977446,"Veteran: Okay, so, so, we had a meter change where we had to, uh, the USS New York we had to inspect nine of our disel engines, um, but they only gave us a three month window in order to do it and it only takes two to, two to three weeks per inspection. So, what we did, in order to get them all done, was we uh, cordinated with the ship with the regional commanders to allow us to meet the ship at their port of visit prior to returning to us. So, and at that time, they had a, uh, ten day a ten day window right there, so uh, a team of myself and uh, others went up there and started the inspection process and got all the open and inspect all the, all the long lead time items completed. But when they came back into port, then all we had to do was the uh, low lying fruit as per say.  "

A3,267.530025,316.726691,"Veteran: The uh, the biggest group I had to coordinate through was actual commanding officer of the ship. Um, of course he's the one in charge of the ship, responsible for the ship. So, it was in uh, doing emails, and phone interviews, or not inteviews, but phone conversations with him, uh, ensuring that, that we were not going to um shut down one of his engines, you know, unless it was something highly critical.That would allow him to sail his ship from point a to point b. I don't want to say places, but point a to point b to get his crew back home and so forth, and then once he agreed to do that then I gave us the confidence that this plan is uh, is the bible."

A4,348.494388,427.5428,"Veteran: Um, uh, my process is uh, once I see it, uh, I try to look at the big picture, the big scheme of things. Um, is, is it going to hurt personalities? Hurt machinery, you know, within the next, the next time it starts, and the next time it opeates? Um, and then okay, is it still going to be there even though, even though I looked at it. It's still going to be there, and, and, and, and were talking internal engine components, so it's still there. So, whether I looked at it or not it's still going to be a deficiency or an issue, so its, its, if it's something major, that has to be corrected right away, then its, its, its at that point, it's an all stop on what were doing. and as communicated, um, up to the highest level that needs to be. And in this case, its, its the ship's commanding officer, uh, what would show physical evidence, if I could, bring him down, or her down, let them see it, and then uh, explain my case, and then this is why, this is how and this is what we're going to do to fix and correct it.
