A1,66.381471,77.97,"Veteran: I'm familiar with the director of Hr. Although when I read the position description. It seemed more of an Ops related position versus a Hr. Related"
A1,77.997141,82.402584,"Veteran: position. So i'm curious to know about the organizational structure."
Q2,84.82,88.640808,"Interviewer: Oh uh, so you were told it was an HR Position?"
Q2,89.888453,103.414276,"Interviewer: Uh well good to know. Well, fantastic. Well, one so like what what we're looking at today is obviously, you know, in in terms of operations. So it doesn't sound maybe too dissimilar from what you're doing"
Q2,103.825322,121.901663,"Interviewer: Uh right now, and in your current role, in terms of like directing, guiding, monitor monitoring this operations team to to make sure that you're achieving specific goals for us. That means kind of around supply chain around our project management piece specifically kind of around what we do. So"
Q2,122.215992,136.713818,"Interviewer: At <NAME>, we are a design, build firm, so construction, so for us it's around supply chain, and then also kind of coordinating folks that are obviously out out in the field. But this aligns directly to some of our senior leaders."
Q2,136.955609,154.698278,"Interviewer: Uh but obviously, you know, reporting into them and making sure that they're aware of what's going on and and managing their budgets. All that good stuff, but obviously leading teams on the ops side of the house for us, which it sounds like based on your resume. You have a good amount of experience in the the operations realm."
Q2,155.16,175.119999,"Interviewer: Um so kind of curious to to hear a few questions and and or ask a few questions, and then hopefully answer, maybe some of yours but uh one, uh you know as as somebody who is in the military, and seemingly has managed quite a few people throughout their career. I'm kind of curious about. You know your management style, and and how you've honed that over the years."
A2,176.319285,186.489041,"Veteran: So um I would say, You know I am a firm believer in there's no one person, not every person is led the same way. So"
A2,187.03549,193.109295,"Veteran: leadership style has to be. My leadership. Style, I believe, is one that um"
A2,194.98,206.432013,"Veteran: changes based on, the organization that i'm a part of, and people that i'm. Leading um. Some people can be led to the water. N0 0ne can be made to drink the water, but"
A2,207.104194,212.486476,"Veteran: some people take more encouragement than others. And how you do that uh"
A2,213.158656,220.84,"Veteran: obviously requires a lot of different tools and and ways to do that. And so I would say"
A2,223.72495,229.073381,"Veteran: more accurately how I would describe it as how I set the conditions for the organization i'm in."
BCI,230.209801,230.877146,"Interviewer: Ok."
A2,231.249505,233.338585,"Veteran: and I would tell you that um"
A2,234.610409,246.516228,"Veteran: That a team approach or a family approach is what I try to take. so that everyone feels like they are a part of the team or part of the family."
A2,247.115871,256.845566,"Veteran: We're all in this together, and we we win together. the water rises. We all, you know. The boats all rise together. So uh"
A2,257.450045,265.511378,"Veteran: that's kind of what my leadership style is characterized by how I try to form the organization that i'm in."
Q3,266.618783,280.168786,"Interviewer: That's fantastic. Yeah. And I mean, I know that's a navy saying with the a rising tide we all sail. So has there been a time where your management style kind of"
Q3,280.584667,289.975854,"Interviewer: came into question or was challenged in terms of like how it sounds like you take a very values-based leadership approach, but has there been a time where there was difficulty around that, or pushback."
A3,290.430422,291.5475,"Veteran: Um."
A3,294.58,297.732529,"Veteran: Well, first everything I try to do um"
A3,299.64,311.67907,"Veteran: Is standards base. I try to be standards based on everything I do, and ensure that there's procedures. and especially in any program that I've ever been associated with"
A3,312.162653,324.610086,"Veteran: cost, schedule performance right reigns King right? And so um and there's parameters to everything. There's rules to everything, and sometimes people don't like uh"
A3,325.964119,337.831251,"Veteran: Um I'm. A person that in that I think I've always been charged with enforcing the rules and the standard whatever that standard is. And some people"
A3,338.759731,356.758699,"Veteran: sometimes don't like that, especially um in the experience I have right now is in is in a an environment where there hasn't been change for probably 40 years, and in the last 3 years there has been massive change. We're in a constant state of change"
A3,357.43088,366.759201,"Veteran: and a lot of the long time employees I've had had had issues dealing with that. So. working through"
A3,367.697352,368.446906,"Veteran: Um"
A3,369.10458,380.72,"Veteran: these types of issues you have to be, I have found that you have to be grounded in the rule or the principle or the procedure whatever that is that you're grounded in fact."
A3,381.45,391.968395,"Veteran: and that way you have a position to move from and and to maintain. so that you know they may not like it. However."
A3,392.756636,401.562687,"Veteran: Um it's not theirs to like or not like. It's the company's position. It is what it is. So"
BCI,403.119825,403.980603,"Interviewer: Sorry"
A3,404.377141,404.957441,"Veteran: Go ahead"
Q4,405.85207,418.004517,"Interviewer: No, I was just saying, it sounds like that. Lends lends itself to being able to measure like you said, measure success, and then see, you know. successive of one, your team overall, and then the success of the individuals on your team."
Q4,418.483264,433.358285,"Interviewer: How have? And i'm sure you have a litany of examples. But can you describe a situation that you've been in, where you had an employee or a team member who was not meeting those performance expectations. And then typically, how how do you handle that on an individual level"
A4,433.788674,435.868082,"Veteran: Yeah. So first um."
A4,437.391369,440.563675,"Veteran: if I have not sat down so number one"
A4,441.864514,442.59956,"Veteran: Um"
A4,444.113176,455.298456,"Veteran: as a leader or manager director. Doesn't matter Someone in charge. And you haven't set expectations with that employee together um."
A4,455.980309,468.804936,"Veteran: Then then you you, that's the first thing you need to do right, so you'll have to take a pause um to ensure that you're on the same sheet of music with that employee, and that you've gone over."
A4,469.660878,478.65,"Veteran: These are the measures of the effective, the effectiveness by which i'm. Grading you. and that you will be graded by the the company; and in this case by me."
A4,479.3132,480.111112,"Veteran: Um"
A4,480.4738,492.519858,"Veteran: And do you agree to those? And then do you need to change them? Let's talk about them. And so. if you have not done that then you're at a position of a disadvantage with that employee from the very beginning, right and so"
A4,493.032456,505.958636,"Veteran: in the cases where that's occurred. um I do have an example where I was new to an organization. and um I had not sat down with this person."
A4,506.746877,519.532818,"Veteran: and I realized that we were not on the same sheet of music. Part of it was my as the manager and leader is my fault for not instigating that to ensure that"
A4,520.519328,523.159692,"Veteran: we were on the same sheet of music um"
A4,523.7545,534.910765,"Veteran: because things weren't going the way I wanted them to go. and you know. So when I started looking at well, why is that? Well on number it's because I never sat down and and clearly articulated"
A4,536.027842,547.894975,"Veteran: the set of standards that we both agreed to that we need we need to perform to And so it did. It took a little longer to to get there, but once we were both on the same sheet of music."
A4,548.707395,549.403755,"Veteran: Um"
A4,549.901845,558.393567,"Veteran: Yeah, in this particular case it's worked out. I've had other cases where people weren't performing, and yes, you have."
A4,560.042586,571.783987,"Veteran: I have never had to fire someone I've had to counsel many and put them on performance plans. But I've never. I personally have never had a a case where"
A4,572.954258,582.287415,"Veteran: I really had to let someone go. I've moved someone to another organization and um side stepped them."
A4,583.389985,595.503745,"Veteran: and that was only because it was they were a good employee. It just they weren't it just wasn't working. And so what we decided between myself and Hr. The best thing to do"
A4,596.233956,603.023464,"Veteran: was they were still valued it just they weren't working in where they were. uh So we we uh"
A4,603.637615,610.23,"Veteran: arranged another. There was another Hr. Work to find another spot for this person."
A4,611.582888,626.81576,"Veteran: but so far knock on wood, and a lot of years of work I never. I've never had to, you know, physically fire anyone. Lots of disciplining along the way, but not having to ever let someone go"
BCI,627.874807,637.07256,"Interviewer:Well, it sounds like you take very much a coach's approach to, to leading, to get folks to again shared expectations where they should be, and then"
BCI,637.56,641.023435,"Interviewer: providing them with tools and resources to get there, and guidance to get there. "
A4,641.40063,650.245368,"Veteran: Well, I've learned if you don't do that, HR Will. You're in a bad position, and you put the company in a bad position."
A4,650.903041,653.233912,"Veteran: because you don't you're not in a you."
A4,654.612124,667.804275,"Veteran: The employee always has a right to better themselves and and know what they're being measured against it, so you'll lose if it ever got to arbitration or um"
A4,668.737591,679.976065,"Veteran: so. I've learned over the years, even in the the Marine Corps works similar to the Government and the university setting, and uh <NAME>"
A4,680.566037,684.705509,"Veteran: all organizations that are very similar in that nature. So"
Q5,688.641877,697.530137,"Interviewer: That's a great. Great point well given, you know. Obviously the structure of the military, and sometimes with the government, you know. folks are usually"
Q5,699.885187,716.757407,"Interviewer: more different to the rank that somebody's, you know wearing on their chest, their sleeve or their collar. I'm kind of curious about, you know. Obviously you've experienced that, especially as you rose to the ranks within the Marine Corps, but like, Can you describe a situation where you were having to influence somebody?"
Q5,717.24099,727.459104,"Interviewer: And you know it? Wasn't just a Yes, sir. No, sir, based on the the rank on your chest like I'm curious about some of the persuasion techniques that you've used in the past to influence"
A5,727.584835,736.284498,"Veteran: Uh so let me give you a scenario. So when I joined <NAME> the team I was placed on um."
A5,737.798113,748.548169,"Veteran: I was the oldest person by 20 years at least. and the gal that I worked with um we had in the"
A5,749.036588,752.189551,"Veteran: the partner that put me on this team um"
A5,752.32979,755.419887,"Veteran: Um we had an arrangement, and I kind of reported to him. But"
A5,757.359055,765.052865,"Veteran: in the workplace I I worked with the team lead, so I was on the team and she was my team lead um."
A5,765.459075,777.185968,"Veteran: You know I was her senior in age by at least this this person by at least 15 years. and so quite a bit of an age difference um"
A5,778.486807,790.465164,"Veteran: quite a bit of a years of experience difference. However, I knew the client obviously far better than even the partner I worked with. However um."
A5,791.543555,802.066326,"Veteran: I will tell you it was very humbling. because the the people I worked with are super super smart folks all mbas."
A5,803.91845,804.982333,"Veteran: and uh"
A5,805.934992,807.472787,"Veteran: that wasn't really"
A5,809.358761,818.740276,"Veteran: what I was there for. But it led me to realizing that the folks that i'm working with and working for um."
A5,819.35,830.259229,"Veteran: you know, put me in a different position, and so I have a great. much greater. much greater appreciation now for influence leadership um."
A5,831.444008,838.60104,"Veteran: I worked. I worked with the gal that was our team lead and helping her understand how to lead up."
A5,839.863192,847.619867,"Veteran: Um It put me in a mentor position, even though I was, I was much more a mentor position, and then"
A5,850.255396,858.481147,"Veteran: worked with the client and help the client. The client would come to me, not the team lead sometimes because they they already knew me, and"
A5,860.35745,873.075689,"Veteran: I knew what I obviously I was, I was one of them, so there was a um it didn't help. But in this particular case, when I retired out of the Pentagon and went"
A5,873.075689,888.651905,"Veteran: back there I worked a corridor or so over from where I was. and where I was working at in uniform. uh. I had already been working with the people. It's just so. I didn't even know it When I"
A5,889.444982,907.458457,"Veteran: Uh went to work for <NAME> that this is where I They were going to place me. You know, I had no idea. I just, you know. So yeah, I ended up knowing all the the leaders and all the people on the team, the Navy team that we went to work for. So it worked out fine, and so I have to believe that"
A5,907.961384,918.576036,"Veteran: they they did that for a reason. and they did it for a reason. put me on the team to help the person, the the team and the team lead"
A5,919.335262,932.633801,"Veteran: succeed. be able to interpret what the Government is telling him, because nobody else on the team and had any real familiarity with government."
A5,933.223772,938.978413,"Veteran: And uh So they were new to new to the Pentagon. new to the culture."
A5,940.482357,945.23,"Veteran: And uh and not that age makes a difference."
A5,947.70709,957.9,"Veteran: But there are. There are folks in government in particular, not just DOD. But government that look at age differently than in the commercial sector. Commercial sector, as I've found in the"
A5,958.7,971.639625,"Veteran: the years that I've been here. Academia is much more like the government but they do look at things differently than the commercial sector does so"
A5,972.81,984.498103,"Veteran: it was a great experience and a great learning experience, and I think it also provided me an opportunity to grow as though the leader. and also to find ways"
A5,985.73,1000.204887,"Veteran: not to reinvent yourself, but find ways that make you successful on the team. I mean the the organization put you there for a reason. and they don't always tell you what that is. A lot of times it's meant to be exploratory."
A5,1001.61,1011.559421,"Veteran: and in my case I believe it was because they didn't really know how you. But that's what I would offer, and how I would answer that question. Yeah."
A5,1012.29,1022.048342,"Veteran: a little differently than you asked, but it's near and dear to my heart. And having lived through the that experience so"
Q6,1023.397539,1038.877038,"Interviewer: absolutely well. And again, I know you have an Ops heavy background. but and, as you know fluently, that you know in OPS sometimes you are keeping the train on the tracks, and that train might have, you know "
BCV,1039.152681,1042.532928,"Veteran: That's what I do every day."
Q6,1042.590958,1047.707268,"Interviewer: So i'm kind of curious like. So what are what is kind of a day to day for you and overseeing. You know"
Q6,1048.22,1060.778523,"Interviewer: projects that have multiple teams, and then also having competing projects like, how do you manage those situations? And and in the past what has been one of your your favorite results that you've you've garnered in a situation like that."
A6,1061.65,1065.720744,"Veteran: So again I go back to um."
A6,1067.761465,1079.822031,"Veteran: although I hate metrics. I really do. I live by metrics and measures of effectiveness are are hard to define."
A6,1081.142214,1092.811077,"Veteran: But when you can at least come up with a shared. whatever it's going to be. As long as your teams understand what that shared measure of effective meat is."
A6,1093.75,1101.578441,"Veteran: The effectiveness is what is. How is productivity defined? How is success defined?"
A6,1102.584294,1119.857888,"Veteran: Uh You know. when you're managing costs and a schedule. you know. And then performance. Obviously. you know each of those. each of those pillars, if you will have varying scales on them that need to be balanced."
A6,1120.67,1130.042151,"Veteran: and sometimes it costs more to be on time. So if the client wants it done. If time is important. that's the most important."
A6,1133.23,1144.73341,"Veteran: then. you know, cost and performance performance needs to be high, but you know cost then becomes something that you need to watch right. And"
A6,1145.681233,1157.374276,"Veteran: I think that what I have found to to keep multiple teams in play is. if there is a way that. and today it's getting so much better with um"
A6,1158.172188,1169.333289,"Veteran: the different types of it support you can have with dashboards and and watching them. But what I've also found is not only just watching the numbers uh."
A6,1169.739499,1176.68859,"Veteran: because numbers don't numbers can lie, but they typically don't if you would. You look at them long enough."
BCI,1176.915874,1180.770033,"Interviewer:  People can massage numbers to make them say different things. But I don't."
A6,1180.9006,1192.158418,"Veteran: Yeah But once you learn the culture and and how things work. Yeah, you can. You can watch over time when that's occurring right? That's why, yeah."
A6,1192.661345,1200.621125,"Veteran: with experience, I think where you take that coupled with um"
A6,1201.525425,1215.220503,"Veteran: team reports. And so now, with zoom and webex capability. I get to see you. And then you're briefing me on your team's performance. I can watch your body language. I can."
A6,1215.9,1226.899038,"Veteran: We're talking through the numbers together. I'm seeing how you're presenting them to me. If you're like unsure of them or you're not. then i'll ask more questions about it, because then that makes me not."
A6,1227.551875,1238.263244,"Veteran: As confident with what you're telling me. And then I also like to get out. Make sure i'm, seeing I also try to carve out time in my schedule."
A6,1238.867723,1249.888585,"Veteran: whether I need to travel to do it, or whether I just need to get in my car and drive to wherever that location is, or just get up and walk to another office or floor to actually."
A6,1251.237782,1265.044084,"Veteran: you know. Kick the tires if you will, and then I do believe a lot in the the whole walk around. Management style is kind of what I explained earlier is you can't set a team or family environment without"
A6,1265.967728,1281.08454,"Veteran: that kind of contact. Whether it's again, it's getting easier with Webex and and being able to see someone and and talk to them. But I also think the personal interaction"
A6,1281.485914,1293.72057,"Veteran: also makes a huge difference. Um It's harder. I call it fake in the bunk. It's really hard to fake somebody when you're in person. and you're actually seeing what's going on"
A6,1295.485649,1305.563524,"Veteran: you it whether it's walking into a maintenance bay or walking to a job site or walking into someone's office. Uh If it's not"
A6,1306.119644,1313.982708,"Veteran: orderly things, Aren't, and you know they're not put where they need to be. or people aren't uh"
A6,1315.960563,1321.923145,"Veteran: Just the way they are behaving. how they're dressed. How they're working, even in workshop clothes, right."
A6,1323.277178,1329.128535,"Veteran: you can tell, and especially when you get used to doing it a lot um."
A6,1329.549252,1342.586656,"Veteran: you can walk into a room into an office or into a work bay. and know whether it's working or not. and if it's in disarray or it looks bad."
A6,1342.983195,1354.502147,"Veteran: then you probably need to spend a little more time there to make sure that the looks Aren't deceiving, and that there are. They are doing what they're supposed to be doing"
A6,1355.27,1365.706771,"Veteran: The other thing I do, too, now is I. I look at like talk to their E. H. And S. Guy, and see what kind of incident watch start watching what kind of incident rates they have."
A6,1366.611072,1374.406434,"Veteran: what kind of safety issues, If not so when it gets to performance. you know uh."
A6,1374.870674,1379.977313,"Veteran: Are we doing anything on the the EH&S. Side that might indicate."
