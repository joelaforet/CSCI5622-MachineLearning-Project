Q1,0,1.119727,"Interviewer: <NAME>, how are you?"
BCV,1.547721,2.805762,"Veteran: I'm well, how about yourself sir?"
Q1,2.805762,31.727747,"Interviewer: Doing good, yeah, appreciate you taking time to visit with me today, and like I told the individual before, I, ah, I married into an Aggie family. I was not an Aggie fan ha ha ha, but I had the chance to come down to your neck of the woods in Thanksgiving of twenty-nineteen and loved it, it's, it's a great place, so, yeah. So, I, I, if we put everything into a resume, it, it would be ten pages long, right? So, I would start out with just, tell me abou yourself, and, and kinda what you're looking to do"
A1,32.791246,83.657625,"Veteran: Oh, well actually when I saw the ah, ah, I've never interviewed for a job that I have no idea what, what the job would be, so. Um, it's a little different. Um, but as far it goes, I figured it's always possible that have to interview for a job later in life. You don't know that you're going to be in a place for two years or twenty. So, I thought this would be a great opportunity to sharpen my interview skills, or at the very least, be, you know, be reintroduced to what they are. But, I actually, uh, came to, uh, Aggieland, uh, well, just under three years, myself. I uh, my girlfriend lives here. Um, there's an opening in the university, that becuase of somebody she knew at the Legion, uh, post. Uh, they gave me a phone interview. They asked me to fly out, and finish the interview. I flew out, they offered me the job that day, so."
BCI,83.657625,88.624943,"Interviewer: That's great. Well, good, so are you a finnancial aid advisor right now?"
A1,89.091846,89.714381,"Veteran: I am, yes."
BCI,89.739673,95.628473,"Interviewer: Okay. Good, so that's for, is it for Hazelwood? Or, what's the-"
A1,96.199132,119.103269,"Veteran: Well, I, I, it's a Hazelwood, uh, the Hazelwood exemption act, and the Texas armed services scholarship program, uh, and basically I review all the applicants if they, if they, uh, they get approved for it, I go ahead and process it all the way through. Um, considering what, what, uh, decade we live in, that process is extremely manual"
Q2,119.479384,151.099025,"Interviewer: Okay, ha ha. Well that sounds like ah, yeah. Uh, arduious, so. Well good, so, um. I guess going into today for this interview, you know, what, what step have you taken to, I guess prepare yourself for this conversation, whether that be going back through your, your resume just to look back over your experince or doing research to prep for questions, or if it's, you know, just jumping in?"
A2,151.890165,164.885604,"Veteran: Um, wa- the thing that I thought was the most important a, a- that I did spend sometime in particular this weekend was refamiliarizing myself with my, my resume because we get so caught up in the day-to-day of whatever job your doing especialy if you've been doing it for years, um, that, that you may forget what you did before and how much of your time and, uh expertise and what knowledge you had to gain to do those jobs, Um, so I thought it would be a good idea to refamiliarize myself especially since I will tell you that, I, I, didn't plan on getting the interview for the last job. I came completely unprepared, uh, that they wanted me for the job was, but nobody was more surprised than I was."
BCI,190.824604,191.213689,"Interviewer: Right."
BCI,192.601425,193.13192,"Interviewer: Yeah, you actually just-"
A2,193.15066,194.858118,"Veteran: I'm actually more prepared for this interview."
Q3,195.234233,214.377216,"Interviewer: Yeah, having, it's, it's sometimes eye-opening when candidates look back through their resume and go ""gosh, I can't believe I forgot that I had that in there, or I had whatever."" So, okay good, refresher, so. So, what are some, um, some strong points or strengths that you would bring to any position?"
A3,216.167007,287.603013,"Veteran: Um, I, I have a good eye for detail. If I, if I, well in particular with this job and the last few that I've had, they, they were, had some pretty strong state and federal guidelines. Um, the paperwork for them was, uh, uh, detailed, uh, and, and I'm don't know if you've ever seen a DD-two-fourteen, but the thing is, the information on there is one sheet. People think ""how hard could it be?"" But considering the, the things the state puts emphasis on, it, it's important to, to be able to keep an eye on all these and make sure you know every detail, becuase I've had a director of my unit walk up to me and say ""here's a, can you tell me a name, and why did you approve this?"" And I've had to be able to defend it. And, and, uh. Uh, fortunately, I'm good with names, and number details, and things like that. Um, also, I'm, especially once I've been doing a job a little while, I'm, I wouldn't say I'm arrogant, but I'm pretty confident, so when they ask me a quesiton, they know I'm not going to bluff. They know , if I don't know the answer, I say I don't know. Um, a, and, so, they, they, uh, I bring honesty to whatever I do. "
BCI,287.901311,289.276078,"Interviewer: And transparency it sounds like."
A3,289.457651,290.145034,"Veteran: That's right."
Q4,290.715692,291.8181,"Interviewer: Good. Great."
Q4,292.155307,300.261244,"Interviewer: So, conversely, going into a different role, what are, what's somethings that you think that you can improve on?"
A4,301.648981,337.718707,"Veteran: Um, well, uh, and this has been true since the beginning of my career. Um, I, when a lot of things were thrown at me from different directions, when I don't tend to write them down, things tend to slip. Uh, so most of the time, I'm really good at keeping a pen and a piece of paper very close by, um, but I've occasionally had to ask people to slow down, or, or, and, and along with that, had a hard time telling them, there's too much going on at this point. You need to, um, spread the work out, instead of just saying ""yeah that I'll just keep trying to shoulder more work."" Not a good idea."
Q5,339.999792,342.619632,"Interviewer: Okay, yeah, nope, that's fair. Definitely."
Q5,343.462649,349.208137,"Interviewer: So in your career, your prof-, your professional career. What would you consider to be one of your biggest achievements?"
A5,350.349453,451.485614,"Veteran: Um, I, there, well, uh, there are two that I really like, and the first is that uh, during the first, I call it ""the first Gulf War"", but during Dessert Storm. Um, the military had an incredibly manual way of doing things. They had what they call RFIs, uh, which is just a request for informaiton, which in particular is for um, uh, intelliegnce. That, that was the work that I did. And they had SR-seventy-one, satillite information, human information, eland, um, and people would just hand them in on their slip of paper and you had a lot of duplication of effort, uh, a lot of unnecessary delays. Somebody would ask for something of it and litterally had a picture taken an hour earlier, but becuase nobody knew that it had already been done, the request would wait until the next satillite passed. And so, I sat down overnight becuase I had a tendancy to not sleep a lot. I wrote a database and overnight, put in over five-hundred of the, I mean, just wrote the database that was back when you could write a database overnight. Um, and litterally save, uh, uh, a couple hundred million in SR-seventy-one and satillite imagry, uh information. Uh, not to mention the time it requires and the delays that could be caused by waiting the, those times. Um, very proud of that, because, no, nobody else seemed to understand the need for something like that. Um, but the other one was very simple. I, I took uh, time off and became a school teacher for two years and taught middle school history and uh, uh, got teacher of the year award the first year that I did it and it was only becuase I loved the kids so much I had a great time doing it."
Q6,451.926577,455.026288,"Interviewer: Yeah, I that's great. That sounds like amazing work, so."
Q6,455.804458,457.127347,"Interviewer: Good, so, um."
Q6,458.618839,472.690747,"Interviewer: You kind of talked about the, what those achievements. That doesn't make sense right there. So, are you wanting to stay put if you are to move? Are wanting to stay put in the College Station area, or are you open to other geographical locations? "
BCV,473.002015,474.42866,"Veteran: I'm pretty open."
Q6,474.713989,475.284647,"Interviewer: Okay."
Q6,476.088756,489.032317,"Interviewer: And what. what is your timeframe? Are you, I guess have you been interviewing? Are you at a point where you are ready to move for the right position, and so, you know, what would that opportunity look like?"
A6,490.173633,512.001301,"Veteran: Um, I, I, in the past I have made made lateral moves for not much of a difference in pay, um, just looking for a new opporunity, or, I mean, don't, I'll be honest  Once in a while I thought the job situation I was in was, uh, tenuous. Um, I, look at the places that I've worked before and a few of them don't exist anymore."
BCI,512.597899,513.376069,"Interviewer: It happens."
A6,513.44736,538.951923,"Veteran: Uh, yes, it does, and, and I, I, was really good at reading the writing on the wall and moving at a moment's notice. I don't feel like that's the case with Texas A and M. I think it's a pretty solid organization. Um, but for the right money and, and, uh, right place especially, I have children that are right with me right now, but they live in Memphis Tennesse. If a job came open closer to Memphis, so I could be closer to them, I would probably take it pretty quick"
Q7,539.392885,540.482323,"Interviewer: Okay, great."
Q7,541.584731,554.541262,"Interviewer: Then, I would say a couple questions here, the last two, you know, if I, I guess why would, why would I, or why would this company select you for, for the job over another candidate?"
A7,558.068966,561.798275,"Veteran: It's a tough one becuase you have to assume you're a better candidate under-"
BCI,561.845127,567.160585,"Interviewer: This is, this is, I would say, and this is - not to interrupt you, sorry, but this is not a time for modesty, so. Ha ha."
A7,567.160585,593.696182,"Veteran: Well, ah, ah, mostly, I uh, say that a younger candidate brings things that I don't bring, the fact that they've got, uh, almost a blank slate that they can bring in whatever other skills. Uh, the experiences that I've had make me very adaptable, um, I, I think that that's not valued enough in some places, but, but some of those places, somebody is willing to adapt and change and move with the company is probably my greatest strength."
Q8,597.068252,597.742666,"Interviewer: Okay, perfect."
Q8,599.947481,607.145554,"Interviewer: And then do you have any qu-, do you have any fears, or any concerns, you know, moving to a, a new position, a new opportunity? "
A8,608.442503,632.474987,"Veteran: Um, uh, you know, once in my life I, I, accpeted a job that I did not ask enough quesitons about. In this case, I can't ask too many questions, becuase it's you know, uh. And, and almost immediately regretted it. Um, uh, and my, my concern in life is that I would make that mistake twice, so I have a tendancy to ask a lot of the questions of the company going in, uh, so that I don't make that mistake twice."
BCI,633.330974,643.615787,"Interviewer: Okay, great, well I think that they asking quesitons and having an attention to detail goes back to one of your strengths, which is your attention to detail - an eye for detail. That's great. Good."
BCI,644.238324,653.706058,"Interviewer: I don't have anymore questions, you know, it's pretty clear cut in terms of what you've done and what you're looking for and what, you know, you're strenghts and weaknesses, so I appreciate your time."
IRR,654.095144,658.621499,"Veteran: Okay, do you have any other recommendations or think that I, uh, could uh, put a little more emphasis on preparation?"
IRR,658.659401,696.103354,"Interviewer: No, I uh, mean, looking at your resume, I think it's great. Um, you know, its, there's the only thing I would say is, on, on the, you talked, you could talk to a hundred different recuiters, they'll give you their own opinion, right? But, I would say under education and training, I would try to bullet that out a little bit, because it's kind of all jumbled together, so it makes it a little bit difficult to, to read and, and kind of decipher through. So, that would be maybe with courses or certifications, breaking that up into one seciton, education to another. So, that's very very clear, if that make sense, right? "
IRR,696.233049,697.25764,"Veteran: Yeah, yeah, that does"
IRR,697.633755,726.101807,"Interviewer: Yeah, and anything that you're, anytime that you're applying to a job if there is a, if you know who you're interviewing with, go out and do some LinkedIn stalking, or try to figure out, you know, who you're interviewing with becuase, if he or she, or a panel has a military background, I would suggest putting your military background or any of that stuff near the top of the first page of your resume."
IRR,726.698404,727.297085,"Veteran: Okay, got it."
IRR,727.346879,744.20723,"Interviewer: Okay? It ebs and flows, right? But you're, you're trying to do everything you can to, to market yourself, just a little bit better, but other than that, I think, it's, it's detailed, um. Yeah, yeah. I, I, think it looks, I think it looks great."
IRR,745.400424,751.690631,"Veteran: Okay good, so just, my plans this weekend was to actually work on uh, making it look more aesthetically pleasing, so I'll work on that as well."
IRR,752.027838,766.709312,"Interviewer: And there's some stuff, that, uh, with all the cadidates, I am, I live an breathe in this world, so, if, if there's a space that's off by once space, or any of that stuff, I have an eye to catch that because it, this is a reflection of you, right?"
IRR,766.709312,766.981672,"Veteran: Yes."
IRR,767.228092,777.119142,"Interviewer: So, I will, uh, I'm going to make some, some changes to some of these, uh, resumes including yours. Doesn't mean it's right, but I'm going to do that and send it to you. Okay?"
IRR,777.147253,778.213259,"Veteran: Yeah good, I appreciate that."
IRR,778.329984,779.575056,"Interviewer: Yeah, absolutely, you can never know."
IRR,779.964141,781.585329,"Veteran: Yeah, it's absolutely true."
IRR,782.130048,785.320545,"Interviewer: Perfect, well <NAME>, it was a pleasure and I apprec- yeah, I appreicate your service too."

IRR,788.692615,795.864748,"Interviewer: I, I am not, I come from, uh, a family of vets and then my, I spent six years in law enforcement, so para-military."
IRR,796.201955,799.846385,"Veteran: That's close. Yeah, and, and daily, no, no rest."
