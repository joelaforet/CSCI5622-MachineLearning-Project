BCV,104.174754,107.055983,"Veteran: In regards, just-just the job? Uh-"
Q1,107.118891,112.239678,"Interviewer: Just the job, yeah. And it could be with a person, or an animal, or uh, anything."
A1,113.824983,127.312658,"Veteran: I think uh- I work in large animal ICU right now, at the hospital, and a major problem that I deal with on a day-to-day basis is not everybody gets along. When working with a bunch of females, it just kinda happens. "
A1,127.89142,141.957856,"Veteran: Um, so I think that dealing with that- as long as I'm paying attention to patient care, and everything is done properly in that route, then everything else can be taken aside. "
A1,142.171746,160.956352,"Veteran: And it's not necessarily, needs to be um, getting in the way of our job. Um, I have had problems in the past with certain individuals, but I like to finish whatever I'm doing first, and then later on, um, just talk with them and see if we can resolve our issues."

A2,180.281975,195.480773,"Veteran: I definitely try to talk to them, just one-on-one, or, if I need a mediator I get my boss involved, um, I share with them how I'm feeling during that time that we had in disagreement or whatever it may be."
A2,195.732408,204.539658,"Veteran: Uh, and just try to feel out, like, what they may be feeling about it as well, and just see if they can get on even ground together so we can work with one another."
Q3,205.646855,223.286519,"Interviewer: Ok, ok, cool. So um, uh, seems like you did a lot, cause uh, you know the job description is-is, you know, uh, assisting the vets-vets with the care of animals and-and helping to uh, schedule appointments-"
Q3,223.613645,239.756076,"Interviewer: and uh, you know, performing initial evaluations and things like that, so, um, you know, from a- from a more of a, uh, a vet tech sort of perspective, um, when you meet somebody that-that, let's say they bring you a horse."
Q3,240.27193,249.142089,"Interviewer: And they say, ""my horse has"", pick-pick something wrong with it. What kind of questions do you ask that person? Initially. Just getting it off the trailer, what do you ask?"
A3,250.110886,263.837614,"Veteran: Initially, I try to get my best knowledge as fast as possible about this animal, whether it be it's- if it's a colic, um, whether they've colicked in the past, they're up to date on their vaccines."
A3,264.366049,276.482309,"Veteran: Um, what exactly is this animal doing while he's colicking, or while he's having this problem. Um, I think especially with an animal who is really sick, dealing with emergencies and everything-"
A3,276.733945,284.283016,"Veteran: Um, getting the information as fast as possible, so knowing what questions asked, so open-ended questions are really good."
A3,284.584979,294.562335,"Veteran: And so, deterring the client to answer specific ones. I need to know what they're thinking and what the animal- cause they're the ones saying the animal [inaudible]."
BCI,295.317242,297.594545,"Interviewer: Ok, cool. Cool cool."
BCI,297.758109,302.778241,"Interviewer: And you mentioned vaccinations uh, w-w-what vaccinations do you usually need to be up to date?"
A3,303.998674,312.831088,"Veteran: Um, I definitely look out for rabies, and um, tetanus, because we have a lot of tetanus cases as well. And then just the regular, um- "

BCI,316.102352,319.939797,"Interviewer: How-how often, for example, do they need to have a [inaudible] test?"
A3,320.405323,324.343422,"Veteran: Um I think annually, 6 months to annually, depending on what they're doing."
BCI,325.224147,327.564359,"Interviewer: Ok, ok, yeah, yeah. Um-"
BCI,331.917657,336.962953,"Interviewer: And-and if you were a vet tech, and the doctor in it-"
A3,337.239752,350.916153,"Veteran: And-and you got a cons- I mean, I worked with vets when I was a kid, cause that's- you know, 40 years ago, I'm an old fart now- and of course we have horses now, so doctor comes in and say ""hey we need to block this horse""- what's he mean with that?"
A3,352.16175,356.779265,"Veteran: We're blocking the nerve to see if that's the specific problem. "
Q4,357.118974,359.723403,"Interviewer: Mm, ok. Cool cool cool."

Q4,383.02487,389.743544,"Interviewer: In the motor pool? So when you get a new person, what's, what's the first thing you do when you meet a new person that's gonna be on your team?"
A4,390.888486,399.255374,"Veteran: Um, I really try to show them the equipment and get them familiar with the equipment that they're working on, it's really important to know exactly where everything is."
A4,399.494428,422.959458,"Veteran: Whether it be tools or switches of any sort, um, and then definitely things to look out for for the equipment, whether it be like, the batteries corroding, because we have lots of problems with that, with our generators. Um, familiarizing them with equipment, and then going into familiarizing them with our teams, and how we operate the equipment."
Q5,424.016328,430.659511,"Interviewer: And it says you're recognized for efficient evaluations on assigned equipment, which you mentioned you don't take care of the maintenance, stuff like that-"
Q5,430.974056,438.196001,"Interviewer: Um, w-w-w-what was efficient? How did you-how did you get something, how was that, how did you make it efficient more than just normal?"
A5,439.579997,450.538733,"Veteran: Um, I made it efficient by getting our reload, and our all of our crew drills done, in a timely manner. Um, sometimes, we're the fastest crew, or the best crew."
A5,450.828114,457.571951,"Veteran: Um, but we try to do everything without any mistakes, and that's really the most important part, when we're working on military equipment."
BCI,459.685691,463.774771,"Interviewer: Cool, so- so- basically, quality over quantity."
A5,464.466769,465.334912,"Veteran: Yes."
BCI,467.197017,471.990677,"Interviewer: So um, are you still doing the, are you still doing cudding horses?"
A5,473.437583,475.991685,"Veteran: No, that was just a short little internship."
BCI,476.092339,477.803462,"Interviewer: Oh, ok, I see."
A5,478.080261,490.007794,"Veteran: I really try to diverge myself into the equine world because I didn't grow up around horses, so I really want to know more about them, so I can better understand the client when they're speaking."
BCI,491.341464,501.281074,"Interviewer: From my experience, let me just tell you that horse is the only animal in the world that I know that from a time it's born, it is continually trying to figure out ways to commit suicide. "
BCI,502.832991,506.502515,"Interviewer: If a horse can figure out a way to hurt itself, it will figure out a way to hurt itself."
A5,507.16935,508.163311,"Veteran: Yes they will, heh."
Q6,508.666583,517.03347,"Interviewer: Yeah, um, so um, c-can you uh, have you worked on- with a lot of horses? As far as vet tech goes?"

Q6,520.002771,522.342984,"Interviewer: So, w-what is the uh, e-eh-"
Q6,525.438103,531.640923,"Interviewer: What is the uh, the biggest challenge that you find in working with horses, from a veterinarian perspective?"
A6,533.314301,540.28461,"Veteran: I think that they're just large animals, and can get hurt very easily because we don't know how they're going to react to certain things. "
A6,540.85079,555.420498,"Veteran: Um, definitely dealing with emergencies and colics, they're, horses are big pansies and um, I think the biggest thing is just safety overall, just paying attention to the personnel around the horse."
A6,555.533734,562.189499,"Veteran: The handler, and the veterinarian, what exactly is going on and what procedure you're doing etc. "
Q7,563.258951,578.696802,"Interviewer: So if I'm a- I'm a uh, a horse owner, and I called you and I said ""hey, uh, I think my horse is-is collicking"", uh, w-w-what do you initially tell me? What do you tell me to do, other than, obviously, bring the horse in, but is there anything else you would tell me like, right immediately?"
A7,580.080798,587.730524,"Veteran: Um, definitely monitor the heart rate, um, check to see if there's gut sounds, if they do have a stethoscope."
A7,587.730524,597.103954,"Veteran: If they don't, then um, stop feeding hay for sure. Um, if they're really concerned about it and it's a violently thrashing at, then you tell them to come in right away."
A7,597.103954,606.150258,"Veteran: But if it's a mild colic, sometimes you can sit on it for a couple days. Maybe just walk the horse continuously for every couple hours, to get its guts moving and everything."
BCI,607.307783,608.540797,"Interviewer: Cool, cool."
BCI,608.855342,622.531743,"Interviewer: Um, so if I have a horse, say, that you know, I had a bag of- 50 lb bag of corn, sitting there, and the horse ripped it open and ate three quarters of it. What do I do?"
A7,623.63894,627.061186,"Veteran: Bring it in, put that thing on fluids. [laughter]"
A7,627.413476,629.804015,"Veteran: We've actually had that happen a few times. "
BCI,630.093396,635.503564,"Interviewer: You can't, you can't help but have it happen in Texas, with deer season and everything, those horses are gonna get to everything."
A7,635.994254,636.547852,"Veteran: Yeah."
Q8,637.189524,644.361141,"Interviewer: So, are you really wanting to focus on- on equine, or are you going to just uh, er, or multiple like, large animals?"
A8,644.889576,662.604731,"Veteran: I'm not sure. I started my- when I got my technician degree uh, back in 2019, I started wanting to work with small animal ER, and I had a really terrible experience at an internship so that steered me away from that and ever since I worked in large animal, I really thoroughly enjoyed it."
A8,663.057675,669.43664,"Veteran: I don't know where that's going to bring me to in the future, but probably along the lines of equine medicine for sure."
IRR,672.468851,687.088886,"Interviewer: Well uh, unfortunately we got a really short amount of time to do these, uh, interviews, so I always like to end by asking um, is there either anything that, that you thought I was gonna ask that I didn't, or that you wanted me to ask that I didn't?"
IRR,690.070769,702.564482,"Veteran: Um, I know you're not like, in the actual veterinary field but I guess I was looking um, thinking that you're maybe gonna ask more things on medicine standpoint instead of um- "
IRR,703.646516,706.389345,"Veteran: As a veterinarian standpoint. Um- "
IRR,706.464836,707.848832,"Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah, I mean uh- "

IRR,725.035551,734.245419,"Interviewer: Makes it look good, kind of odd, if I have to give it a uh, if I have to do uh, an injection is it, is it subcutaneous, is it- is it intermuscular?"
IRR,734.346073,735.45327,"Interviewer: Whatever, uh, so- "

IRR,735.855887,744.713464,"Interviewer: Very good to be brushed up on those, for sure, but, but uh- yeah, I'm not, I'm not really qualified to ask those. I know what we do with our horses, but "

IRR,745.418044,752.036064,"Interviewer: You know, as I think most horse people are, you know, it's like mm, probably not the-the by-the-book way to do something."
