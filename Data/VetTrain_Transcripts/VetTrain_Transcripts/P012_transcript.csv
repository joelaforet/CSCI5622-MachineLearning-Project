Q1,0,53.623257,"Interviewer: <Name>, so most companies that you're going to start with are going to explain their interview process, um, I do understand completely that the university might have not told you, um, like, where I work, so typically, um, you would have already known about my company, would have already read a job description and, then I would ask you what attracted you to this company and this role, and then I would ask you about your skills as it's compared to this role, then ask about your leadership style and your teamwork style, so I'm gonig to still going to do that and you might not know who Haskell company is, so I'm going to ask you to just, just fake it, and I'm also going to understand that maybe you didn't read a job posting that was on our website, and I'm going to ask you to just fake it. It's okay, this is a coaching session, chief's here for you. Ha ha ha ha ha."
BCV,53.852899,58.292633,"Veteran: Alright, I apprciate that, when they said Haskell was going to be doing the interview I thought that was going to be a person."
Q1,58.484001,91.820281,"Interviewer: Gotcha, well it is, <NAME>, he actually is, he actually is a person. Um, but the <NAME> company is fifteen-hundred people following, Preseton started in the sixties. So, so, yeah it's really, if you get time to read about it, I don't think it fits where you're trying to go. We're more of a civil engineering type group, um, but you know, you never know. Um, so, basically Steven, tell me a little bit about what you think the Haskell company is the right fit for you and your career aspirations."
A1,92.470932,142.456216,"Veteran: Um, I as you can tell by the CV, I've already done good amount of stuff in the field of psychology and many more from the standpoint of the organizational psych side, you know, being able to come in and you know, help with efficiency, help with um, you know,  just a lot of stuff happens nowadays, you know, there's mass shootings, you know hirings, firings, all kinds of stuff. And, um, having someone there to bring psychology and, you know, the ability to help. Um, going around helping employees rest, or you know, help being there during HR's hiring and firing sessions, um, all of that would be a benefit for your company."
Q2,142.877226,197.68498,"Interviewer: Absolutely, definitely, with most, most enviornmental health and safety, and organizations that have to deal with OSHA implementations, that's actually stright up, you know, aligns with that, um also with organizational stratagy. Also, with Haskell, we do a lot of, uh, human, um, machine interaction and human, um, interaction not only with computers, but with the spaces that they're in. So, when we do a design we would like to make sure that people aren't bumping into each other in and out of a door. We do a lot of that pshycological reasearch of how people use that space before we actually design a space, so there's a lot of that. Again, I'm going to ask you to just think of a job description that you just read and tell me why your skills, your particular skills align to that job decription. What does Steven bring to the table?"
A2,198.833187,288.699533,"Veteran: Um, I, I would say I guess I kind of the best of both worlds where I have a background in construction. I was in the military as in the CV, I did that for five years, was pretty much um, foundation up, construction. Um, I was depployed I was in charge of several projects, um and then after I got out when I was doing my undergrad, um, I was doing um, updates and um, standard operating procedures writings for an Earth mine in Long Port California that uh, uh, was bringing it up for thier ISO nine-thousand certification. So, I kind of have both of, of, ah, I have both of those experiences, an on top of that, I have a degree in psychology, um would be a benefit to your company similar to what uh, some of the jobs are to where uh, you also mentioned uh, looking into spaces, looking into stuff like that. Um, making sure that people don't get frustrated being a builder kind of at that ground level, being able to say ""Well, okay we can't do this becuase that's not going to be correct with code, or correct with this electrical thing we can't have an expanse of wiring, it needs to be broken up"", etcetera, etcetera, you're going to get more free money essentially becuase of the experience that I have and that I can bring to your company "
Q3,289.465004,365.323223,"Interviewer: That's excellent, we actually teach a class here that we call the Haskell client experience and the Haskell way and it talks about how to help your customer make the best decisions for them as a company, in other words, you're not always going to pitch the most expensive solution. You're going to, to make sure that they're going to make sure they're compliant You're going to make sure their needs are met. And then, if they want the Cadillac solutions, then we start bringing those in. We have, we have clients with basic needs and clients with um, shall we say, very Gucci taste. Ha ha ha ha ha. So, we need you to be able to bridge both of those clients to make sure their goals are met, so I like how you brought, brought that. I also like how your brought the ISO one-thousand because if the process is set, people will follow it, correct? So one of the things that I mentioned when your going for a job position is you're going to know that job description very well. Um, and I like the fact that you kept your skills concise to the job description, um, because your interviewer doesn't want to know everything everything you've every done, they just want to know what your can do for them."
BCV,367.887552,371.561815,"Veteran: Yes, yeah, yeah, I've had many interviews "
Q3,371.944551,391,"Interviewer: Yeah, I got you, I got you, so yeah it's, it's that. So, typically like I said, we'll follow the um, why doe you want to work for us as a company? How do you fit the job? and then, um, what are your leadership skills and what are your team working skills? Tell us about how you approach a team and how you approach leadership."
A3,396,515,"Veteran: Um, I guess the easiest way to explain it is it's a bit of Walt Disiney approach mixed with a, um, it's more of a military approach where at the end of that day, if I'm in charge and my name is on this, and I'm the one who's going to be signing it off to the big bossess, you better have a really good reason to not envisioning this to be done, but at the same time, I want everyone to have the freedome to work on their, you know, work on thier projects, work on thier stuff, uh, different pieces, uh, according to how they do it, because one thing doesn't fit all, but um, I do uh, I, I do take that approach of leadership kind of also with that there's the uh, uh, share a piece of mind in work, I'm not sure if your've seen of it, or heard of it, but extreme ownership, that, that, that's kind of where I subscribe to a lot of the stuff to where it's just, you know, if I have to own it at the end of the day, I want to make sure that my foot print is in it, but I also don't want to smash in anyone else's foot print either. Um, as far as working in groups, and teams, um, I actually like to play the devil's advocate when it comes to certain stuff where it's like when I start to get all these ideas, I want to come back and respond , ""How much is this going to cost the client, how much is this going to cost the company?"" Well, how much is this going to get us to kind of get some outside the box, not necessarily unconventional thinking, but just you know, outside the box thinking where it's like ""oh, okay, I didn't like take into account how much this is going to cost us. Alright, let me see what we can do with this, right?"" And take into, you know, take this into account, take that into account, and um, in a very non-threatening way obviously, but it's like that's how I like to um, do the group stuff, or how I like to get the group, or team working."
IRR,515.546991,569.050831,"Interviewer: No that, no that's excellent. I think the socratic method is awesome, sometimes you realize that most people just want to suggest a bunch of stuff without thinking it through, so asking them the how of the thing they just suggested is good. Um, I, I, do like that and Haskell, a part of the Haskell way which is um, is one of the way that we teach our team members is how that they interact with a client is about servant leadship. That is our leadership style here. And that is what we teach our up-and-coming supervisors and also our transitioning supervisors on how teammembers are to be treated. We have lots of extremely talented architects, engineers, and designers, and it's like hearding a bunch of cats with mice and dogs in the middle."
IRR,569.34508,570.154266,"Veteran: Uh huh"
IRR,570.200243,571.98413,"Interviewer: Hahaaha"
IRR,572.177231,576.899526,"Veteran: I have to say I'm a pshcologist you get a bunch of lists together and it's not, uh hm."
IRR,578.047733,592.241365,"Interviewer: Um, as a, a instrcution, instructional designer, I used to have four PhDs on my staff. Yes, they were all right, at all times, but so was the customer. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."
IRR,592.324122,593.318888,"Veteran: Yeah."
IRR,595.462208,674.497133,"Interviewer: So, yeah, I feel you on that. So, one of the things when you have multiple job offers that you're um, you're fielding is you're going to want to find that right fit. So, you need to think about some things that, that are of value to you that when you go to figure out if this is where this company is where you want to move to have some questions that would reveal that company's stratagy to you. Are they the type of company that has no regard for anyone they hire and it's just, it's just a job mill? Or, is it, is it a company that is truly vested in bringing on the best and brightest talent. And do they really want to grow and develop that talent? Or do they not care and they just, I'm in for this and I'm out for that, or no, I want to find a home. So, whatever works for you, you're going to want to develop some questions that really reveal to you what that employer's all about. So, I uh, kind of feel that you have done some thought in this area. What kind of questions would you ask your employer and what would you ask of me as a potential employer how that I could make you under, uh, convey to you, uh, whether Haskell is the right place for you."
IRR,675.64534,691.988155,"Veteran: Um, I guess kind of a first question I would ask in either situation, whether it's just a job to have a job and get income, or it's just looking for a home if what is the, uh, turnover rate that you guys have? If, how, what is the average time somebody stays with your company."
IRR,692.715353,793.183478,"Interviewer: Well, believe it or not, we subscribe to Gallup, and Gallup actually gives us that information every year. Um, so as far as how our team members feel about the company, because turnover is a leading indicator of engagement. If you have high turnover, you have low engagement. So the industry turnover for construction is about twenty-six point nine percent. Haskell is at about seven point four nine and that's volunary turnover. So, we only track voluntarty turnover because involunary turnover is volumn growth and I can tell you that we're adding four hundred team members over the next three years. And um, we have everyone from eighty year olds to twenty year olds in this company. So, we don't have static, I mean people don't just come here untill they, until we wake them up at their desk, you know, at the office desk, we don't do that. Um, but we don't do that. I've worked at companies, where it's like that. So, what it's like is you're going to find a healthy turnover here at Haskell, you're going to find it highly engaged um, uh, workforce. Our, our, surveys are eighty-nine percent participation. Our um, our grand mean for engagement is about uh, fifty-four percent of our team members are highly engaged in what they are doing. And we have about eight percent that are just not engaged and everyone else is in the middle, so our ratio is about ten to one, so ten really engaged team members to one not engaged team member. So, that's, if that gives you a, of, how we are as a company."
IRR,794.408232,802.10122,"Veteran: Oh, awesome. Um, and then, I guess do we have time for me to go down both of those lines for questions for you, or?"
IRR,802.10122,806.885416,"Interviewer: I have all the time that you need until they give us the thumbs up. Chief's here for you. I said that."
IRR,807.612614,896.598668,"Veteran: So, if, for me, if I'm just looking for a job first would be the turnover rate just to kind of give me an idea of what I'm in for, right. And then um, the second one would be more along the benefits side. If it's like I have a family, like, you know, what kind of insurance do you guys have? Are ya'll inclusive, is that something I have to pay for? You know, and it's matched, um, you know, what's the starting salary? Salary for an individual with my experince. Um, I, I, I go down that route if it's um, more for a home, then it would be for more like, okay, what's the retirement look like? What does the company do with four-o-one-ks? What does the company do with IRAs. Um, is there any, and I'm not sure if this is a publically traded company, but are there an stocks? Is there any options for anything when I come on I change my options for questions accordingy for what I'm looking for that way in retirement, packages or accounts. That type of thing, um, bonuses, incentives, um, all that, and then, usually for me I do. Again, I thought they're justm who they, who they are telling me who it was who is interviewing me otherwise I would have done some research because I usually do that, um."
IRR,896.598668,902.849235,"Interviewer: Yes, do that with no matter who you, and at least know their headline from their website. Ha ha ha ha."
IRR,902.913807,905.350355,"Veteran: Oh, no, absolutely and in the past, "
IRR,905.368745,909.80305,"Interviewer: And I knew that, I knew that they didn't prep you guys, I know. Ha ha ha."
IRR,910.109239,1046.967093,"Veteran: But, uh, and like in the past, I, I, I liked the program as it was. I like the program with who was running it and I liked to know what's going on. You know, all, all, all that kind of stuff and so, having that um feel, and unless something pops up during the interview and I didn't read about any of that, what are you talking about? I usually don't have that many questions for the company. And depending upon the rapport with the interviewer, I do the when would you like me to start kind of a, ath the end, but um, or, and again depending upon the rapport, would you like me to start. I can start of Monday if that works for you, kind of a, kind of a thing. And uh, I usually had done the research uh, you know, where I'm going, how long it's going to take me to go there, what the commute is, what the commute is during the work-start times. Um, all that stuff, so um. I mean yeah, aside from, aside from that, it's like very few questions from me becuase to me I view it as if they're trying to, if I'm applying for a job at this level, the amount of rearch they're trying to do into me, I need to do into them. And so, most of my questions get answered during that. Um, and it more of those, you know, okay so, what are you guys doing it on? Would I have my own office? Would I be sharing an office, like, what's, you know, can I have my own office? What's, are we starting close to the starting rate? Or, because of what you want me to do, can I have my own office for privacy, you know, we're starting up here. It, really, kind of again, varies what what I would be doing, but um. Yeah, and, normall I, I do have interview questions in my head, but the way that the email was read to me was like okay like they, they've got your resume, they're going to ask you like specific questions, like based off your resume kind of thing, like that's how I thought it would be, so I went in with my normal ""okay, they might give me a phsycological question, give me a scinerio with somebody "", you know I had something like that in mind."
IRR,1047.013069,1049.173964,"Interviewer: Yeah, like a behavioral phase, not just like,  "
IRR,1049.210745,1049.762463,"Veteran: Right"
IRR,1049.82683,1285.879163,"Interviewer: yeah. Just to understand, um, Haskell and most companies, um, most large companies like your smaller companies do not, um but, your talent advisor would like walk you though the whole benefits package, the person who's the recruiter, for the, basically pre-screens you, that person that asks you all those benefit details, of you know, insurance, all of that, that TA will answer all of that before you get to the interview. Here at Haskell, we pay a company to do all the behavioral, phsycological, um, uh, we used DISK, so we do a DISK assessment on every team member before they come in an see if they're a good fit for the team, you know, you have so many eyes in one room, ha ha ha ha ha ha. My boss and I are both high eyes, thank goodness for the rest of the team, ha ha ha, um, but she's a West Point grad so we do great, um. So, yeah, you're definitely going to want to hit up that, that, that talent advisor up, get all those questions um, answered. You're also going to get um, becuase um, I, six months ago I went through the job process. CSX got rid of our department, um, so there was eighy-five of us, who we left. We called it the brain drain, um, so we were all out there, but I gave everyone my best advise on how to interview for a management training programs and that's why I volunteered for this because it's, it's fellow veterans and interviews can be, can be dicey, but but I also want you to interview that company and interview those people, um, you know, you, you think about companies that say their all about diversity, yet everybody one panel looks exacly alike? I had a problem with that, I had to join the PTA, I don't need to sit around a bunch of middle aged white women, that's, that's not who I want to work with, you know, that's who I am already, so I don't need more me, so I think that finding that finding that diversity of thought, that good fit is important. When you, when you go come this far, um, also asking about the day in the life is an excellent question you mentioned, you know, what is my work enviornment like? Asking what is a typical day, what is a typical week, tell me about your um, your company's philosophy. Do you have, like we have a twenty-twenty-five strategy. We have exactly what we're going to do the next five years as far as people strategic operations, where, where are our steaks in the ground, or we just meander, you know, if you're a company, if you're at a stop and you have no idea what you're doing. Um, review their financials make sure you're not, you know, make sure the company that you're interviewing with doesn't have a lawsuit against them. All these, all these things that are very important for Steven to do bofore he gets that, now I will tell you, with this being a CV, the length is good, the CV is important. If you're um, interviewing with your typical dummy-dumbs, I'm just interviewing for the job and they don't, I would keep it to two pages, but that's, that's the reusme, the CV, it's different, I get that. It's just becuase if you're interviewing that hiring manager only has limited time to read and they on;y want to know what applies to the job description. and while you migh have other fantastic skills I will tell you that I was overlooked when I just went out with my original, um, resume, but when I started tailoring my resume to every single job, for every single job that I was applying for, that's when I started getting hits back.and it's, it's a little frustrating."
IRR,1286.414993,1382.972367,"Veteran: There was a great, I don't, I don't, I haven't been in Barnes and Noble in a while becuase they're too expensive, ha ha ha. It was close to over a year, but there was a great, um, Military to Civilian resume book that I got when I got out and um, one of the things I would do is keep mine to one page and it would be tailored like you were saying to which ever, you know, like, which ever, job I was like looking for, and um, I, I went through and I edited my skills, and you know, put, you know like, okay, this company wants leadership skills, so I put in my leadership and stuff I did in the military and then it was like okay this company, that construction compnay, I need to put down all the construction projects that I did, and actually, wait, I mean, hold on, I've got old, old resumes on my computer still, but um, yeah, but just kind of, uh,  I don't want to say sad, but it's more annoying than anything to be honest with you, like there's stuff on that CV that, that's current, but there's stuff on that CV that isn't current, but I haven't put on there, becuase it's, it's like okay, where am I going to put where am I going to put that I'm reading this book chapter, where am I going to put that I'm teaching here, and it's just like I, no. Like, I, I can't go through and."
IRR,1382.979214,1384.075803,"Interviewer: Right "
IRR,1384.075803,1385.326363,"Veteran: do all that"
IRR,1385.363144,1443.374909,"Interviewer: it's a part of hte program, and you're right. When we write our CV as to where do I put everything that I do, is differnt than reading five bullet points in a job description and just answering those five bullets on the job description, so no, you're spot on with that, but while you have me before they come in and give us the thumbs up, what advise do you, do you have any questions on the interview process? I just, how do we use applicant tracking systems are real if it says job, if its in the job posted says puppy groomer, don't put dog washer, the computer will not find you. I'm not kidding, it's I have litterally gone in and ready to pop my TA's head off going I just met this person randomly that I applied for this job and never saw thier resume, why not? And it would be something that the applicant tracking system screened an absolutely fantastic candidate out."
IRR,1446.130606,1497.177931,"Veteran: Alright, um, I didn't really have any questions for you. And I would say mainly more for me just to get my, get my, I don't to say my anxienty, but get my heart rate down when I would interview is whenever I got the actual, well you have to apply first and it's like if they send me a thing for an interview, they want to make sure what I put down matches that and they've already made their decisio, and so I kind of just treat every interview liket that, where it's like if they're talking to me that's going to be more inherently positve, so don't worry about the interview, just answer the questions, go thourgh what you know, ask you questions and move on. For me that's worked pretty well and I see, um."
IRR,1498.097461,1501.321096,"Interviewer: Yeah, I can see you bring your authentic self and I like that "
IRR,1501.933474,1536.791262,"Veteran: I, I do, you know, and even some of the practicums where I had to go interview, and there are are some where I do not want to be here, and I would just straight up tell them, give it to them, I would not be interested in this. Like, I have no, ha ha, it's like sorry, I don't if you want me to, but yeah, their, a lot of the sites wouldn't tell you what it is, and I have no interest in working with sex offenders, and three of them were on sex offender sites, no thank you, like, ha ha, so."
IRR,1536.838971,1575.880397,"Interviewer: Yeah, this one isn't for me, and that goes for a lot of jobs and like, I had three offers on the table when I chose this one and it came down to after meeting um, my boss online. I was just like, if this woman is walking into hell, I'm walking in behind her, so um, that's been my experience since coming here is that she is a force of nature and all of us are jsut excited to work with her, so, um, and that comes with good and bad, but I am super glad to be here, and I chose for who I wanted to work for, versus what I wanted to do. Alright Steven, if you need me you can find me on Linkedin, I wish you the best of everything brother. Thank you for everything."
