Q2,84.629559,96.001653,"Interviewer: Alright, can you describe a time where you had to deal with a major change in your work process, or job duties? And then, how did you deal with that change? "
A2,96.001653,186.545769,"Veteran: Alright, so, the last Summer, um, through the Summer, I was informed that all the classes will be virtual. So, after the lockdown, A and M is pretty putting all the classes online through Zoom. And so, that mean for me and my team would have to move our orientation event online. And so, about a couple of weeks before school started, um, our vet vet camp somebody rescheduled Beth and co-Ball in the MSC and we would have to place reserves and everything. I guess the good thing is that we haven't made cat catering plans yet, uh, we've been assigned a catering contract. So we met for hardly every other day to make a new schedule, to make this event virtually, and, so after about two or three weeks, uh, we have to contact all the students, all the resource providers. I was commenting to present to the students. And we had to make a new scheudle and convincing it so that way not everyone's like ""What's it about."" Um, for the event and the results of that were able to reach more students through the virtual platform, through Zoom. And, we had a pretty positive, um, feedback from the students and faculty that attended."
Q3,188.647134,190.810304,"Interviewer: Alright, thank you for that."
Q3,192.54084,209.784395,"Interviewer: Alright, so what is the toughest work, or school group that you had to get cooperation from. And how did you go about establishing rapport, and, with them, and, what accents did you take to gain where confidence."
A3,210.526053,273.567007,"Veteran: Uhuh, so I'd say one of the toughest group that I had to work with was in the military. Um, it was a new group, uh, when I came back from deployment. They have a bunch of personnel changes. So, even though I was there before them, like, I was pretty much the new guy coming back, and, it was though for me becuase I, they were younger than me, and we haven't worked together, so we didn't we were like ""no way"", but each other's personalities were. And how I over came that, and est established rapport was that um, I kind of talk with them one-on-one. You know, see how they work, um, see what they need from me. um, honestly, like, do well at school, and not at school, at work, and um, so kinda see what they're goals are and see how I can help them achieve that goal, and at the end, um, we're able to reach a mutual understanding, work better as a team."
Q4,274.803105,275.606568,"Interviewer: Alright"
Q4,279.253054,291.614026,"Interviewer: So, tell me about a time when you, or your team were not meeting an established goal or deadline. What steps did you take to ensure that, that goal or deadline was met."
A4,292.602903,293.591781,"Veteran: Okay"
A4,295.075098,299.401438,"Veteran: So, let's see. Can it be like, a school project?"
BCI,299.448562,303.604168,"Interviewer: It could be, it could be anything any way. You can use any, uh, example."
A4,304.284021,305.705533,"Veteran: Alright."
A4,307.312459,308.363142,"Veteran: Um."
A4,309.537434,382.942895,"Veteran: Alright, so this kinda goes back to the Vet Camp story I was telling about earlier when we did online, and so, through the Summer, when we first met, we had established timelines for our deliverables to ourselves, uh, when we send out emails, and had the whole schedule figured out, but as it got closer to the beginning of school, um, more and more stuff came up for us and then we weren't, we were falling behind on the deadlines we had set for ourselves. And so, because of, like um, I was also working another job at the time and that was a not good anticipating how much time it would take to move the whole event online, and, I was, so I had to reach out to other of our faculty, like, other colleagues that are our resource center for help. And, through reaching out or help, and asking for help, um, we're able to, um, get back on track and reach out to other people that we were supposed to reach out."
Q5,383.826873,384.506726,"Interviewer: Alright."
Q5,387.349749,401.812086,"Interviewer: Alright, so how do you react in a situation where you need to make an immediate decision on a major issue? Can you give me a a example, uh, where you were involved?"
BCV,402.430135,408.239791,"Veteran: Uh, um, so like, major situation, it is just, like, what do you mean by that?"
Q5,408.919645,466.459967,"Interviewer: Uh, you know, it could be, it could be work related type of decision, um, you know um. Like, for, like if you were let's say um, I don't know, you're, you're, you're told to, uh, I don't know, get ready for deployment, and you're on deployment, uh, get ready for deployment and you had to make a decision maybe, uh, how you're squad or, you know who you work for put you in a leadership position at that point in time, right? And you had to make and a need to make a quick decision, you know, for your leadership above you and said ""Hey, we need to know how your squad is holding up, we need to know it now."", right? Maybe you weren't prepared at that point in time to do that, but something like that, or, or just react to a situation that, that happens while on deployment, or while at school. Something that came up, some quick change. Uh, you know, uh, you know, it's more or less kind of seeing how the decision making process goes."
A5,467.01621,561.268617,"Veteran: Okay, so I guess, uh, I guess I'll start off when I leave on deployment, so that's when at the end of deployment, um, our squadron was, or you know was about into two different ships, and so I had to get out of the parts that was on my ship to, back to, um, the other one. And so my leadership was told ""Hey, there was transportation"", um, ""arranged and everything"", but when it came to the day that I was supposed to move out of my parts, um, nothing was really set up. Um, and so, I had to reach out to, and like the ship supply, logistics people, and then you know, say ""Oh, hey, we got, we got a truck"" so, you know, I asked them if I could used their truck and kind of work with them on that, so I kind of secured transportation. I had to get all these parts off the ship somehow, so I went and talked to the crane operator to see if they can help me out, get onto the dock, so I can get over to the truck to get to the other s, to the other ship. And, this along the way, every forklift driver I saw, I just asked them for help and see if they can put these things on the truck, so I can get over. And, so the end result, was that thorough reaching out to everyone I see and, um, just kind of see what oppoetunities and resources I have around me, I was able to move all the parts over. "
Q6,564.915104,570.910175,"Interviewer: Alright, alright, thank you for that. So, how would you define leadership?"
A6,573.505979,590.44051,"Veteran: Leadership. So, leadership it would be um, understanding your team - people you're leading - and um put them in, put the right people in the right places and give them the tools they need to do their jobs and succeed."
Q7,594.334216,603.54314,"Interviewer: Alright, so can you tell me, uh, tell me what was your most impactful leadership role that you've had? That you demonstrated those behaviors that you just discussed?"
A7,604.470213,650.329417,"Veteran: Okay, see, so it would with, so I had a small team when I was working in the accounting division and, um, when I first met them, you know, they were freshman out of training that didn't know a lot. So I, I was able to identify, like, what they need, or like what their weaknesses are. And then, try to catch up on their training, so they understand what they need to do. I then I always just make them feel like ""Hey, if you have any questions, you know, feel free to ask"". There's no dumb questions, becuase I want to see you do well. You know, and, they feel comfortable enough to come to me when they have questions, and, um, we're able to work together as a team."
Q8,653.419659,658.549463,"Interviewer: Alright, and what would, what would have been your greatest challenge you face in that role?"
A8,659.66195,662.010535,"Veteran: My greatest challenge?"
A8,663.741071,725.978562,"Veteran: I would have to say, the initial, um, establishment, like, establishing rapport initially, because, um, like, being in the military came from different backgrounds, and, like, being from Texas, I didn't really understand I guess like how they grew up, or the circumstances they grew up with, just becuase our lives are so, so different. And it took a little bit of conversing and, you know, just, kind of like a one-on-one on a personal level, to like, communicate that. Um, kind of like that understand like ""Hey, I'm sub here just like you to do this job"" and just getting that trust initially, that. After that, after we establish rapport, like, we're able to, you know, be honest and accountable to each other. It's in my team."
Q9,727.338269,735.929144,"Interviewer: Alright, last question I have for you is: Um, Why should we, uh, make you an offer today?"
A9,738.957582,772.14679,"Veteran: Um, I think I bring in, uh, unique experiences like unique experiences from my military, um, and school, um, work enviornment work experience. And that, let's see, and I do believe that these experiences that force under pressure and on the time, um, under time constraint becuase, very valuable to an organization."
IRR,774.680789,776.720349,"Interviewer: Alright, do you have any questions for me?"
IRR,778.6363,787.536199,"Veteran: Um, let's see. Just like, um, what's it called? When should I expect to hear back from you?"

IRR,794.890977,795.336772,"Veteran: Alright."
IRR,795.385416,834.322476,"Interviewer: So, within twenty-four hours you would know, uh, one of, actually, one of two things, right? Yes, or no, right? Right, if it's no, that's pretty simple. Uh, a yes, there's pretty much a well, there's a lot to come on the back end of a yes. Uh, which means, you know, just, for more, the pre-hiring process. And, and the procedures you have to go through to uh, make a contingent offer because that's what you would get, a contingent offer. A contingent offer would come there. I mean, you go through the process. Once you clear the pre-hiring process, then it would be a an actual formal formal offer at that point."
IRR,834.816915,835.805793,"Veteran: Okay. "
IRR,837.350914,838.834231,"Interviewer: Good question, any other questions?"
IRR,839.884913,849.8973,"Veteran: Um, I guess um, just, I'll follow up on that one, um, just in case. I know, this might not happen. Um, in case I don't hear back from you in the next couple of days, who do I, who should I follow up with? "
