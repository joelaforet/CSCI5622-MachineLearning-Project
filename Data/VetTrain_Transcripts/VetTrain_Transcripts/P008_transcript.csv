IRR,0.271802,2.434972,"Interviewer: Hi, <NAME>. How are you doing?"
IRR,2.434972,4.289118,"Veteran: I'm doing good. How you doing?"
IRR,4.598142,7.193946,"Interviewer: I'm doing well. Thank, thanks for asking."
IRR,7.193946,16.201631,"Interviewer: Alright, right, um, we're going to go through the interview. We'll go ahead and start and if there's anytime you don't hear me clearly, or understand a question, just let me know and I'll repeat it "
IRR,16.218785,16.604742,"Veteran: Okay."
IRR,16.63905,18.251494,"Interviewer: or, rephrase it, alright?"
IRR,18.504235,18.971947,"Veteran: Alright."
Q1,18.997678,23.695843,"Interviewer: Alright, so can you tell me a little bit about yourself; your education, educational background, work experience?"
A1,24.499306,72.892509,"Veteran: Yes, I'm uh, I graduated from Texas A and M. After graduating from High School in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Went into the Air Force, uh, spent uh, seventeen years on the Air Force working as as civil engineer, um, various bases around the world. Um, after that, I came back to Texas A and M and was the construction superintendent for the campus and then and moved from there to what they call the BSL3 lab maintenance manager, which takes care of some labs that have some special products in them that we don't want to get out. So, I'm in the high containment lab business presently."
Q2,72.892509,87.725675,"Interviewer: Okay, alright, alright. Thank you for that. So the next few questions, I'm going to ask you, Frank, is, is, uh, we use the star method, of re, of interviewing. I don't know, are you familiar with that method?"
BCV,88.034699,89.95065,"Veteran: I'm not familiar, no."
Q2,89.95065,91.186747,"Interviewer: Okay."
Q2,91.186747,122.03971,"Interviewer: So, star stand for, uh, situation, task, action, and results, okay? Uh, so basically, just formulate the, the, I want to ask you about examples, give me examples. So, just formuate like in a story, you know, a beginning, middle, and ending to a story. But, if I have to take, what we do, we, when we introduce, or, or we, we inform people the method that we kind of analysing the answers, um, so, it's more example based kind of, uh, questions, that we'll ask, alright?"
BCV,122.336395,123.077507,"Veteran: Okay. "
Q2,123.197582,123.635,"Interviewer: Alright."
BCV,124.089572,124.346877,"Veteran: Alright."
Q2,124.381185,124.85291,"Interviewer: Alright"
Q2,125.859272,136.489707,"Interviewer: Okay, so describe a time where you had to deal with a major change in your work process or job duties. And then, how did you deal with that change?"
A2,139.518145,230.185871,"Veteran: They moved me, well, I was a construction superintendant. We built a building on campus where we were bringing the, the departments from four different, uh, from four different colleges into this one building. We called it the interdisciplinary sciences building. They moved me from being the construction superintendant to be what the call a building proctor and I had to take the, uh, eighteen scientists with all their people and bring the building up to speed so they could get the science done. So I went from being the guy who, uh, took and plan and, and went with it to the one that's listening to all these people, and developing a plan and then trying to help them figure out how we're going to get the plan executed. Uh, it was highly rewarding, uh, I had, uh, four months to do what most people would probably get two years, and we managed to get ninety percent of it done. I had one guy that, uh, got hung up, and uh had some specialized equipment that we couldn't get in in time, uh, to meet the dealine. Very reward, very rewarding experience."
Q3,231.916407,246.131524,"Interviewer: Awesome, alright. So, what is the toughest work or school group that you co, that you had to get cooperation from, and then ho, how did you go about your establishing rapport and getting confidence from that group?"
A3,248.541913,389.209768,"Veteran: I went from being a, on a flying squadron down to a, uh, civil engineering squadron back in the early part of my Air Force career. When I did that, the base civil engineer thought it was interesting since I was a captain to put me in at the roads and grounds, uh, department in the civil engineering outfit, which is the lowest of the low. Usually, the Captain goes into the engineering or maybe even being what we call a chief of operations, uh, uh, because I was new to civil engineering put me in roads and grounds. I was in charge of fifty, uh, enlisted personel. And the roads and gorunds guys who drive all the heavy equipment take care of snow removal, cut grass, um, um, those kinds of things. When I first when down there, the roads and grounds department at that particular base had no operational equipment. So, I had the challege of getting my newfound group of men, uh, to understand how we were going to get the equipment back and how we had to be safe once we got it back so we didn't lose it. So, that, that's probably my biggest is challenge, is, is, getting those guys to understand because the reason we had lost all, or they had lost all the equipment is because through various acciendents and safety mishaps, they'd had all the equipment had been broken and they guy who's in charge of fixing it had decided since they had such a poor safety record, he was going to punish them and not give them any equipment to work with. So, I had to change the culture of my guys to get them to be more safe and respect their pieces of equipment and I had to get the guy who fixes the equipment to understand that I really need the, the equipment for my guys to be able to complete their mission."
Q4,391.558353,406.267909,"Interviewer: Alright, alright, so tell me about a time when you, or your team were not meeting an established goal or deadline, and what steps did you take to ensure that goal or dealine was met?"
A4,408.431079,517.331237,"Veteran: When I first got here, uh, one of the things that, one of the things that my construction group would do every year was we go into the dormitories on campus, uh, and they would give us three or four of em every year, we would take them apart basically and repaint, redo, uh, fix the electrial outlets, put new base board, just a general overhaul of the dorm. When I had, when I got here and took over, the last, the two years prior, they had even though they only had four dorms they got two of them completed on time, which was totally unacceptable because when moving day comes in August, you need to be ready to be able to move the people in. So, uh, I sat down with the five foreman that I had in my outfit and we figured out how if I would put one foreman in charge of each one of the dorms and then, let them manage the people in the uh, vendors that were coming in and delivering stuff for them and all that they thought that they could, uh, turn these dorms out in a more timely fashion. And we, we took that process, we did a few modifications to it and becuase of that we were able to turn out all four dorms out at first year with two weeks to spare. And the two weeks to spare came back to haunt us, becase they gave us a fifth dorm that they wanted to turn out, but we were able to do it."
Q5,521.410358,534.265768,"Interviewer: Alright, oh, so, how do you react in a situation where you need to make an immediate decision on a major issue?"
A5,536.490743,561.150881,"Veteran: My first reaction is to try and gather a little more information, um, and the, the other thing I try and do is stay calm, so that I can keep the guys around me, and the young ladies around me calm, so that we don't start panicking and making, uh, a bad situation worse."
Q6,562.881417,569.988975,"Interviewer: Alright, so can you give me a life example? A real life example that uh, that you were involved in?"
Q6,571.595902,573.573657,"Interviewer: That, uh. What was that?"
A6,574.129901,658.926165,"Veteran: In, uh, Veteran's Day of nineteen eighty four, up at Tinker Air Force base, there's a building that's over a mile long. And that building, we would bring B-fifty-twos in on the s, on the north end, and we could kick them out on the south end and they would be totally refurbished. Well, that building caught fire, and the fire was between the roof and you had the built up roof and you have the metal deck, and the insulation, which was supposed to be non-flammable, was flammable and was burning. Uh, I got tasked, uh, to go up on the roof. We had to cut a trench all arcoss this building and this building was was a half mile wide. So, we had to cut a trench all the way across, so that we could get the fire fighters up there, so that they could shoot the water in to where the insulation was and put the fire out. That's uh, I work with my NCOs to get that done. My NCOs were great. I said this is what we got to do and just looked at me and said no problem. And we put over three hundred and fifty guys on top of that roof, cut that trench, in two hours, and stop the fire. "
Q7,664.612212,667.455235,"Interviewer: So, how do you define leadership? "
A7,671.225331,709.853367,"Veteran: Leadership for me means that I am blazing the trail, I am up front and help, helping my guys understand what we need to do in order to accomplish the mission. Whether, what's the details, what resources do we need, then I try and help them get those resources, getting the uh, guys to buy in that this is an important project and then keeping them focused on it as we're moving forward."
Q8,713.685268,721.658095,"Interviewer: Okay so, um, what was the most impactful leadership role that you've had that demonstrated that behavior?"
A8,723.697655,834.575569,"Veteran: I was in the, I was stationed in Ankara Turkey. I had just beem there two weeks, I am, uh, told to go out to a, uh, bay, a Turkish Air Force base about a hundred miles from Ankara. I am the only American there, but I am going to receive a bunch of trucks, a bunch of equipment and what have you, as well as a fifty man civil engineering unit and we're going to build a bare-base and get it ready to support twenty-four F-fours. Uh, that probably is the most uh, most imactful leadership role that I had, that I had in my career. I almost had another one, but they decided to cancel it at the, at the end. When uh, people were killing each other in Rwanda and they were all gathered around the lake, and didn't have any fresh water I went and found what we call eighteen ROPRO reverse osmosis machines and loaded them on one-thirties and, uh, they were talking about sending me even though I was a Major, down there to help the people set those up, but at the end they pulled back and said, no we're not going to send you and they ended up sending three NCOs down there which was a good idea becuase they actually knew how to run all that equipment. But, the, setting up the colocated operating base was a, the, the biggest leadership challenge that I had."
IRR,835.873471,842.795615,"Interviewer: Alright, alright, wow, that's my next one. So, what questions do you have for me?"
IRR,845.576833,864.303705,"Veteran: So, in Union Pacific, I can only imagine what kind of facility problems that, that ya'll end up with. Are your factiliy, your facility problems aren't only with your tracks, but you also have a significant nunmber of buildings I would imagne."
IRR,864.736339,866.714095,"Interviewer: Oh, yeah. Yeah. We do, we, we have, we I mean, we have. I mean, we operate in twenty three state network, I mean tracks is just one I mean tracks is one major portion of any, and is more of our infrastructure to that, then we have oversee the support buildings and the utilities that we operate in or operate through and stuff like that, so we do have a lot of those as well across our net, our network, so I mean, either everything from you know large towns to small rural areas. You know, we have, have tons of facilities that are made and utilized, I mean not, not, you said dorms, we have a few dorm facilities, and you know, but uh, but, uh, and, and those are been turned over, usually the dormant ones are turned over to a stable state. See what we want to do with them. But um, um, but, um, I mean, um, you could, I mean, I, I, I'm in Oregon right now, so I eh, you know we have the main building that I'm in, the headquarters building, here I'm in. Uh, you know, and then, that's one facilty I'm in down the yard, you got and it looks like three yards, in Portland, and it's you know, like, good Birdie plus buildings, right? Everything from, everything from, large facilities, you know, like crew facilites down to, you know, shanty shacks, you know, where crews hang out. You know, stuff like that. Um, so yeah, tons of facilties and stuff like that and mutlifacet and whatever, I mean, just think of anything from high tech to very, you know, very, you know, primative, I guess is a good word to use. So, it's not really major, but yeah. Yeah."
IRR,979.322544,980.435032,"Veteran: Yeah."
IRR,982.536397,991.312687,"Veteran: Wow, and then do you all, you use a lot of contractors, or do you try and have more in house?"
IRR,991.312687,1099.100357,"Interviewer: Well, when it comes to facility maintenance in itself, like, and it, maintainence it, so we have, we have pretty much kind of like what, I mean, what you're, so we have managers that are facility maintenance managers, but they are managing more of the processes of the processes. So it's like a combination of both, right? So, you'll have facilites that they're not obviously that, that, they'll have the ability to contract and bid out resources, but they are managing the facilities, so like here, that manager you know, they have a huge network that will come around right, and, they have certain inspections, right? On certain days on certain weeks, whatever. They'll fly in, they'll fly in if they're not from here, like late in does it for us, just based out of Montana. She'll fly in, she'll have her, she have a few dotings on her agend, go in and inspect she needs to inspect. And then if there's something that she needs to, uh, put a bid in, uh, put a bid out there for an external organizations to do the work. There are certain things obviously that we have to complete control over in the context of maintenatnce like our signals or something like that we don't have outside the self. We've got our own people that do that. So, uh, I guess it depends. If it's air then yes conditioning unit then yes, they'll prove that they, they'll, go out and bid that out of town if it's a signal then we have our people do it. Uh, I mean it really depends on this. Uh, we yeah. And if it's tracks, tracks is a different part of that. So, that tracks are not even, uh, facility and maintenance doesn't even, even go near that, or the, or engineering group"
IRR,1099.780211,1101.387137,"Veteran: Right, right, "
IRR,1102.685039,1105.175971,"Interviewer: Yeah, so good question. Any other."
IRR,1105.210278,1108.989135,"Veteran: Your track is like my air strip. That was my whole life "
IRR,1108.989135,1168.507212,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, just think you might have a facility of the air strip you, you, you use, but you're not managing it, you manage the air strip, and that's your strip. Exact samething, so engineering does the, uh, does the tracks, and they have a lot of the, a lot of other, I don't necessarily want to call it facilities, but they, they have certain things that they, they are responsibile for like towers and stuff like that, and bridges and all that. That doesn't fall under that building management group at all, long time engineering. Building management is like a, a piece of real estate. I would say that just take a real estate and major in that regards, or anything real estate. Uh, what we would consider real estate, uh, uh, is building management is in infrastructure, it's uh, infrastructure in regards to trains moving then uh, that's engineering.  "
IRR,1169.030468,1169.776652,"Veteran: Oh okay"
IRR,1170.16261,1170.394184,"Interviewer: Yeah."
IRR,1170.428491,1173.018967,"Veteran: Wow, that's kind of neat the way you got that divided up."
IRR,1173.018967,1183.587597,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, just, yeah, just, you know, facility maintenance is, you know, hey, it's just take uh, yeah, just, just, just, I guess you just take it like an appartment building, right? You have an appartment building. The owner is the facility manager of that building, but the highway that gets to it is done by the department of transportation, right? It's like that, so it's literally that different. That, or, or, or, or actrually, say the department of transportation's factility is literally a faciltiy manager, right? But, that factility manager has not control over the department of transportation in regards of building a road. So, uh, you know, so, it's, uh, area of separation there. Yeah, um, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, our facility managers, they got um, shoot, I mean, we've only got four for our whole netowork."
IRR,1225.244071,1226.418363,"Veteran: Wow."
IRR,1227.036412,1290.015561,"Interviewer: They travel a lot, um, they travel a lot. That's, that's the field manager, that's not counting the support staff or their, or their supervisiors if they'll let that, but you got four and they, they travel. They got in, so you take our three-and-three state network and you divide it in quadrants for four, right? And then they tell you one part takes the northwest kind of area, one take the, uh, north easts, and then the south west, south east area, right? And they just travel and they have a design, um, you know, a metrics of when they go out and travel and go out and put out bids for buildings painted or something like that, and they go out and do that. Um, we we do have some people that will cross-polinate into a field like that, so we, we do have certain positions that, that can do that type of maintenance, that type of work and you'll cross-polinate and you'll use that if it's a minor fix if it's like a major repair or something like that then they go out in town and get those bids."
IRR,1290.448195,1291.251658,"Veteran: Yeah."
IRR,1291.560683,1292.055121,"Interviewer: Yeah, "
IRR,1292.055121,1293.600243,"Veteran: Wow, that's incredible, ha."
IRR,1293.600243,1296.814095,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot of work. Most guys get a lot of work."
IRR,1296.814095,1335.380326,"Veteran: Yeah, yeah, that, that's what's uh, kinda neat about when I had moved from the construction side into this uh, uh, high containment. The contruction side was always about the deadline and can I get the work done on the deadline. The, the, high, containment side is I have to maintain this factility and I get inspected once a year to make sure that I'm maintaining my high containment status. By CDC, so it's a different kind of pressure now."
IRR,1335.874765,1404.107327,"Interviewer: Yep, yeah. And it literally, it literally is that exactly the same picture. Our engineering group, if something happens on the rail, first signal, bridges a structure it's it's not well get back to it in a year and inspect, or something like that, it's like, it's, it's now. It's like, it's, everything is like an emergency at that point, right? Becuase that stops the flow of traffic when it comes to like what you're saying, it's exactly that; the building maintenance, you know, the manager, you know, they, it's a they, they're longer, it's a longer process in regards to getting anything done. So, you'll have a lot of that with that, so yeah, yeah. When it comes to engineering, it's like a bridge, like there was a you can go on Google, there was a fire, train fire bridge union pacific Arizona. It literally, uh, uh, a wood train, uh, carrying wood caught on fire and it literally caught on fire and they had to stop the train and where it was was on the bridge, it literally burnt the entire bridge down in Tempe Arizona."
IRR,1404.354547,1438.718047,"Interviewer: It burned the bridge down within fourty-eight hours, fourty-eight, yeah. I'll just give it fourty-eight. Fourty-eight to seventy-two hours, that bridge was back up. Alright, so you went from like that, demolished, to new bridge, there you go. And building maintentance, you, you use as well as you know is yeah that's like, you know. Something gets burnt, or something like that, or something gets destroyed, okay, we'll get to it, we'll just removet the parties and put them somewhere else, and we'll get a cubicle somewhere else, well coordinate us off we'll sit maybe six months, maybe seven months, maybe a year, they'll be new again, but. "
IRR,1438.965267,1452.62414,"Interviewer: Yeah, when it comes to engineering department, there's no prolong, there are no prolonged projects, like, huge gigantic projects, but, yeah, when it comes down to a rail train moving, all bets are off "
IRR,1453.056774,1453.798433,"Veteran: Yeah."
IRR,1455.343554,1456.826871,"Veteran: Alright."
IRR,1457.07409,1463.749015,"Interviewer: Well, I appreciate you very much. Thank you for spending your time with me today. Uh, yeah, enjoyed it."
IRR,1464.737892,1467.519111,"Veteran: Alright, thank you, I appreciate it too."
IRR,1467.88994,1469.991305,"Interviewer: Yeah, thank you sir. Have a good day."
