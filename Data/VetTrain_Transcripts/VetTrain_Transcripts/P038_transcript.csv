Q1,0,1.555384,"Interviewer: Hi, <NAME>, how are you? "
BCV,1.997036,3.930064,"Veteran: I'm good. Everything is good. Yeah. "
Q1,4.23,31.249,"Interviewer: Great great um! So it's very nice to meet you, and thank you so much for for attending this interview. Um. I was wondering if we could start, and if you could tell me something about yourself and uh um, what? What? What have your studies been on? And uh, I I saw that you just graduated from Texas A&M. Uh, So maybe you can describe a little bit more your academic trajectory."
A1,31.46,34.698096,"Veteran: uh that that last one might be a little typo. I've I've just been "
BCI,34.720804,35.152259,"Interviewer: Oh"
A1,35.402049,38.740151,"Veteran:  forgot to add that, and present, so. "
BCI,38.916599,39.921518,"Interviewer: Okay, okay"
A1,40.057226,47.005928,"Veteran: I'm still here at A&M. Um my experience before this a little bit is uh I joined the military out of high school."
A1,47.38,59.669,"Veteran: Um, I did enjoy it. I felt it was quite an experience. Um. I learned that it wasn't going to be me, for you know, career wise. But it was definitely a good growing experience for me."
A1,59.68,72.799,"Veteran: Uh when I got out of the military. I went, and I tried to get into business. Uh I became real estate agent. That didn't really work out um. I went to boxing, and so, like my coach offered me a job,"
A1,72.81,88.65,"Veteran: and I took the job. I really liked it. Uh, he offered me the business half the business, and then I decided to take that on, and it was really fun again wasn't something I wanted to my career, but it was just a good hobby of mine. Um. I, I came to A&M to pursue economics."
A1,88.66,104.279,"Veteran: Uh it's something i'm very passionate about I've been investing in stocks since I was, you know, very little, and then I got serious about it about a few years ago, and so i'm trying to pursue something along the financial investments track, and that's kind of what's brought me here to A&M. Yeah."
BCI,104.31,109.561748,"Interviewer: Yeah, that's great. That's great. Uh, so you've had a long path. Haha."
A1,109.881786,113.075763,"Veteran: Yeah, a few roadblocks, yes. But, I'm here.  "
Q2,113.671033,116.372153,"Interviewer: yeah, yeah. Exactly. That's the most important. "
Q2,116.749797,129.506505,"Interviewer: Um, so can you tell me a little bit about the, about what were your responsibilities and uh and what you were doing as part of the uh real estate uh agency that you were workign with?"
A2,130.063371,133.366161,"Veteran: Yes, uh so I went to Keller Williams uh "
A2,133.82,147.34,"Veteran: I went there. It was late 2019, and I started with them January 2020 and so I got my license. I already interviewed with them a little bit, and I decided to go with them because they had the best"
A2,147.35,167.039,"Veteran: beginner program. So every every program, whether it's like global banker or it's like Remax. They have like a starter program for new agents, and Keller Williams by far had the best one by the interviews or by the uh recommendations. And so I went with them. Um, I thought they are very. They're really good at educating um."
A2,167.05,176.589,"Veteran: I figured out later down the line that the industry wasn't for me, because I just didn't like it enough. But I had great teaching had great experience behind me."
A2,176.6,192.88,"Veteran: Um! It was a worthwhile experience, I would say, because there's a lot of things about real estate that are very applicable, you know, working with people working on contracts, sales like it's all very good skill sets. And I felt like it was again, it was a really good experience. It just wasn't for me."
Q3,193.34,216.5,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, that's a that that that makes sense. And and then you went on to work for uh Garcia trading capital, and it appears that then you applied more uh finance based skills and management uh uh skills. So maybe you can also discuss a little bit this um, and maybe any potential leadership skills that you had during this job."
A3,216.95,236.379,"Veteran: So this was a joint venture with my father. Um, he, he's a real estate investor. He doesn't know too much about stocks or trading. Um, I came into that knowledge I traded before I started that up, and we started it up as an organization. Because um, we want our assets to be managed by us, and"
A3,236.39,249.65,"Veteran: we paid so much for education that it made sense for us to create a legal entity around what we're doing, and so we decide to go this route to kind of write off some of the expenses, and also be able to"
A3,249.66,260.73,"Veteran: uh work on a project together. And so, when create this partnership, we had it in mind that it was really a learning process, and so I trade the markets from about 2020"
A3,260.78,274.399,"Veteran: Um! I started right in the middle of pandemic. I did it with my own personal money, my own personal account, and then I start trading his money, and what that evolved into is eventually being seen as something I really like doing. He wanted to do it in the future,"
A3,274.41,290.049,"Veteran: and so I I paid quite a lot of money for education from professionals. Uh they were professionals in the industry. You know It's It's not just some random Youtuber all right. It's someone who's been in the industry who knows about finance, knows about economics, and knows about trading,"
A3,290.06,298.85,"Veteran: and we uh use the company as a vehicle to purchase this knowledge, and purchase this education, and also be able to execute on trading platform."
Q4,299.32,308.119,"Interviewer: Okay, how did you uh manage and handle the risk that this associated with? Uh, you know, with finance, with this type of investment."
A4,308.35,325.68,"Veteran: Right. That's a very good question, because there is a lot of risks in it. Um. However, our trading style we follow very, very strict and very stable rubric, and so our system that we use uses options, and so we use equity options which could be risky. But we"
A4,325.69,346.229,"Veteran: uh, we walk in our downside risk by created by only buying options. So when you buy an option, you basically only kind of lose as much as you paid for the option spread, and so that's what we do. So we don't try to take any. We don't sell any options, which means that your risk can go like through the roof like we don't do anything like that. We make sure that our risk is very really tight managed,"
A4,346.24,360.51,"Veteran: and so we can only risk a certain amount per trade. So we're not risking more than probably a couple of percent points of the entire asset in our management for every any one trade. And so that's how we can kind of deal with our risk from a, from a technical standpoint,"
A4,360.52,370.469,"Veteran: from a personal standpoint, you know there's so much that happens in the markets like the volatility, like really everything. The last two years has been kind of crazy um, but"
A4,370.48,387.34,"Veteran: through that time we've still been able to eke out profits, because we just you just stick to our system. We manage our risk that way, and whenever there's a volatile market kind of like there is right now we take risk on, so we don't risk nearly as much as when you know things were really booming, you know, early in 2021."
BCI,387.994652,388.991085,"Interviewer: Yes, that makes sense. "
A4,389.081917,391.015809,"Veteran: So, I think that's primarily the way we handle all this.  "
Q5,391.598278,398.107848,"Interviewer: Mhm, mhm. And are you interested in following a similar career now, after you graduate from Texas A&M?"
A5,398.408683,404.412593,"Veteran: Yes, um, I'm trying to get into oil, basic commodities training within the oil industry."
BCI,404.81584,405.225489,"Interviewer: Mhm,"
A5,405.272848,423.34,"Veteran: So i'm trying to go through a program called Trip, and it's It's done through the Mays School of Business. Um, I'm applying it for it. I've already applied for it, and I have an interview next week, and so I made it through the first part of the new process. Now I got the second part. If I make it to this part again the program. And so i'm super excited about that."
A5,423.35,435.97,"Veteran: Um, I realized when I came here. It's what I wanted to do, because it matched so well with my personal characteristics. Um! And the the head instructor of the program is a great guy. I've met him a few times, and he's"
A5,435.98,443.354795,"Veteran: he's really I can see him being my mentor. And so, for those reasons I I I know this is where I want to go. This is my path."
A5,443.445295,448.819,"Veteran: and uh, I'm really thankful for A&M for that, for brining me those opportunities. "
Q6,449.057869,460.022364,"Interviewer: yeah, thats thats really great uh what do you think would be the skill or the characteristic in your CV that would actually make you stand out from the other applicants in that program?"
A6,460.969676,481.31,"Veteran: Um, I actually think this one ties back to my military experience because I I've dealt with a lot of pressure, and I've had to adapt. You know our our motto in the marine corps is adapt and overcome. And that's because when we're being dealt very difficult situations, a very difficult mission, and we're the odds are against us, or maybe things just aren't working right."
A6,481.32,488.219,"Veteran: We end up finding a way to make things right. We end up finding a way to overcome whatever options are in a right, and that's just the mentality that we have."
A6,488.27,503.98,"Veteran: Um, We do a lot of. We do a lot with very little, and the marine corps is known for that, because we don't get as great at funding. And so oftentimes we're we're working with a very outdated year, and we're just kind of have to make it work, and so I think, through those experiences. And then also,"
A6,503.99,513.43,"Veteran: like I've I've been in the markets trading, and I've also done something like real estate, and it's all managing uh stress, it's managing people. It's"
A6,513.44,528.18,"Veteran: It's dealing with uncertainty, and I think that's probably the key thing is just doing this, not knowing what's going to happen. You know that there's a reason why I want to go into trading versus accounting is accounting relatively stable, trading is volatile, but I think I can thrive in that type of environment."
Q7,528.3,533.547854,"Interviewer: Mhm So what would be your ideal job after after all this?"
A7,533.816685,543.725056,"Veteran: Oh yes uh so the job specifically is uh is being an analyst for a trade. And so, you start off that way and then that's, you start off  "
A7,543.815441,550.07,"Veteran: at that, like position as an analyst, first, before you can really get into trading, because there's"
A7,550.08,579.09,"Veteran: um like, I spoke to one of the heads of commodity trading, and he told me that you know we need a good analyst, because you know, when you're a good analyst and you you get to understand the industry from the inside out, then potentially, can become a trader down in the future, and so that that trader role is really what i'm after. But I know that have to go through these different steps right after I exit college to be able to get to that position. So um again i'm looking forward to it. I've still got to manage uh GTC, on my own,"
A7,579.14,587.58,"Veteran: you know. Just do a little bit trading on the side. But my overall goal is to be trading for a company for a big company in commodities."
Q8,587.75,590.329,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, that's that. That's great."
Q8,590.34,609.7,"Interviewer: So a a few more general questions, I guess, since you have all this so wide variety of experiences. I I was wondering, um, If there is something that you are the most proud of throughout your career.so far. It can even be from the military or from more the civilian world like what, whatever you choose."
A8,610.06,624.77,"Veteran: Right. Um, I definitely have an answer for that. I do. It has to be um, the time that I became undergrad of my um, my, let's see what it's called, my schoolhouse. So basically after going through boot camp"
A8,624.78,641.01,"Veteran: that's about thirteen weeks in boot camp you go to what's called MCT, which is marine combat training. And so you do that for about a month, and then you go to what's called your schoolhouse, in Westview. So it's basically your military occupation. And so when I went to my comm school because I was in comms"
A8,641.02,659.159,"Veteran: uh this was in 21 poems, and I don't know if you know what 21 poems is, but it's a desert, and so you're in the middle of nowhere. Um, you're on a very isolated base. Um, what that allowed me to do is it allowed me to really focus on myself.  You know there were there weren't very many distractions uh we had Internet. But you know,"
A8,659.17,673.019,"Veteran: like being in a place where it's kind of isolated, you really get, have have a lot of time to really think about yourself and think about what you want. And when I was in my schoolhouse uh they, they said, Hey, you! You got top of the class"
A8,673.03,685.769,"Veteran: you got promoted. You got promoted and so when I was there, that was my entire goal, it was just that, and it wasn't anything else. And so i'm very proud of that experience, because I I did end up achieving that."
A8,685.92,703.89,"Veteran: And I achieved it because I I basically did my research. I studied very hard. I I tried to use my resources. I tried asking people in the other classes how the class was, and stuff like that. And so I used a lot of techniques and strategies to really get that position where I was top of the class,"
A8,703.9,723.26,"Veteran: and it was the first time I ever did anything that was very high performance. I feel like in my life, because everything before that, you know it was. You know, I played sports, you know I did competitions in high school and stuff like that, but nothing really amounted. It never really mounted anything great. I felt like that was my first real experience, doing something that was substantial,"
A8,723.27,725.709,"Veteran: and I got merit or supermoded. So I was happy about that."
Q9,726.03,732.82,"Interviewer: Yeah, that that sounds really really, a well accomplished thing. So congratulations! Yeah."
Q9,733.04,739.54,"Interviewer: And um. And now, in contrast to that, something like something more like"
Q9,739.82,750.05,"Interviewer: I would say not a failure or something that was a challenge for you. And maybe what lessons learned from that and how did you um overcome this?"
A9,750.3,754.769,"Veteran: Yes, um, I would say the biggest challenge I've faced,"
A9,755.16,760.63,"Veteran: it It probably I could think of one right now in the military. It was when I got promoted to corporal."
A9,760.98,779.38,"Veteran: Because I had gotten promoted so fast to lands corporal um in the schoolhouse. I got promoted to corporal very fast, and so I was barely twenty when I got promoted to corporal. And in the Marine Corps uh it's a very serious rank, because it's when you become an NCO, it's when you earn your blood stripes, and it's a very, very"
A9,779.39,799.159,"Veteran: uh historical uh rank, because it's when you start to read people. Um! I felt I was really really young when I started that, and I never really had any leadership experience before. I was a very good individual. I can work hard. I did my task right, and I was very good at managing myself, but managing other people was something I hadn't done at that point."
A9,799.17,818.97,"Veteran: And so when I uh, when I achieved the rank of corporal, I I didn't exactly know my leadership style, and that hurt me a lot. I feel like there's a lot of growing pains because I just didn't understand. Um, there's a lot of other aspects too like I was, I had all these um corporals that we were now my peers,"
A9,818.98,832.749,"Veteran: saying I had to act a certain way, and then all my friends who were under me. They expect to me to act a certain way, because I've been friends with them for so long, and so that was probably one of the most difficult experiences I've had, especially military. Um,"
A9,832.76,852.259,"Veteran: I, luckily I did figure that out by the end of my enlistment, because I realized I just had to really be myself, and I didn't have to, you know yell at people I didn't have to be super strict if that wasn't me right if it's not me, and it's not something that's genuine, it's just not worth doing. And so I think that was one of the huge challenges I face"
A9,852.27,862.412318,"Veteran: um very early on, and I think I'm I'm I can reflect on that, and be very happy where I ended up, but I was definitely going through a hard time."
Q10,863.295622,874.292122,"Interviewer: Yeah, I can't imagine that. Uh, yeah so so how would you um, how would you apply the lessons learned from this into any future experiences in life?"
A10,874.727373,893.846433,"Veteran: Uh, yes, um. I'd say being genuine. Becuase we each have traits about us that make us unique, make us who we are and if we're not doing that, if we're not showing people who we are and wha'ts genuine and truthful to us, then I think we're we're really lying to ourselves."
A10,894.569718,901.092089,"Veteran: Um, becuase I was trying to be something I wasn't and um that's just not a good thing and I don't think that works out at all um. "
A10,901.36,924.92,"Veteran: I'm I'm part of uh the corps of cadets here at A&M, and I in my leadership class. I I do give those these stories. And so that's why, like It's really on top of mine right now. Because I've I've given this story before where i'm like. You know, when we get promoted. You have this, you know, inflated ego, and you want to like, use your power and stuff like that. But it's really not about that you know It's really about just being who you are and trying to be"
A10,924.93,941.98,"Veteran: the type of person you want leading you, and that's why I learned a lot from that experience. It's like, you know, at the time I got promoted to corporal like that person wasn't the person I wanted to be. You know it was, it was not genuine. And then, now, looking back on it, I can reflect and be like, okay, like what, what"
A10,941.99,949.86,"Veteran: should I have done? Who who am I, really? And what's what style is the most effective? And it's definitely the one that's most genuine to yourself."
BCI,950.53,972.729355,"Interviewer: I completely agree. Yeah, um so that was great <NAME>. It was really a pleasure uh thank you so much for taking the time you know to be here today. Is there anything, any questions that I can answer, anything else? Any final things that you would like to say um. And if not we are, we are done, yes."
