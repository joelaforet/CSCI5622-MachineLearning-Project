A4,442.29,452.4,"Veteran: So let's see how many can you do in an hour, how many can do by the end of your shift and then we'd have balls and stretch goals for our people and then we."
A4,452.85,468.36,"Veteran: strategize to see how we would do it, and then do the daily check and then do a weekly check in comparison to our from our other team and and just you know, keep it fun interesting light, but always looking to see how we can grow."
Q5,469.62,473.55,"Interviewer: And you tell me about a mistake you've made in the past, what happened and what did you do about it."

A5,480.36,493.56,"Veteran: Well, actually, what I do is I don't really think of mistakes as mistakes, I think of it more as definitely opportunities for learning, I once had a."

A5,502.86,516.42,"Veteran: I wouldn't necessarily call it a mistake, but the interaction that we had it started off a TEE It started off on good footing and my problem was, I did not realize that the satisfaction, he was starting to get."

A5,550.41,563.97,"Veteran: Military wasn't his his thing so then we worked through how to help transition him out so it was a learning opportunity for me that way because I didn't really have a lot of people that were transitioning out that worked with me."

A5,565.2,572.04,"Veteran: First, one that did it early out instead of transferring to another so."

Q6,615.6,628.5,"Interviewer: Over the years of experience and now you're pursuing an MBA at Texas a&m What would you say in from a working environment perspective is what you enjoy I know you love strategy um but can you speak to that at a high level."

Q6,646.44,647.49,"Interviewer: And what's the least thing you."
A6,656.16,678.75,"Veteran: Most favorite is actually working with people and I love developing people love it I I had so much training and developing a mentoring, that I did that I never got sick of it ever even after transitioning from military going into cracker barrel, I still do it here at school."
A6,680.28,687.54,"Veteran: I bet is my passion, I love working with people I love, making sure people are always you know."
A6,688.08,700.59,"Veteran: encouraged and working at the top of their game and just trying out new things and I like to try and keep things interesting and a learning experience out every time I work with them and talk with them."
A6,700.95,718.92,"Veteran: So the least favorite would be repetitiveness so um I know people need some things to be repeated over and over it's just some some people's learning style and stuff like that So for me it's when there's lack of variety."
A6,720.36,738.33,"Veteran: That to me also stunts people's growth when things are a little too stagnant, so I think that's my least favorite about anything that's, the main reason why I didn't become a manager record girls and Sullivan stuck at one store."
A6,739.8,740.58,"Veteran: stuck at once."
Q7,742.65,744.03,"Interviewer: Great at greater response."

Q7,759.84,762.9,"Interviewer: And then, why do you think you're the best candidate for this position."
BCV,766.47,767.49,"Veteran: executive buy it."
Q7,769.83,776.4,"Interviewer: Or it doesn't even have to be executive buying it could be just buying maybe on program development obviously you have experience in developing teams, maybe there was."
Q7,776.4,780.15,"Interviewer: An initiative that you had to help lead to create the buy in."
Q7,781.35,786.21,"Interviewer: Because it's really dealing with change management or not everyone's comfortable with change."
A7,788.13,789.63,"Veteran: yeah they really aren't."
A7,792.54,796.86,"Veteran: Well, for just creating by in one of the things that I had to do."
A7,798.21,821.76,"Veteran: Oh, this is an interesting one military decided that they were going to create a mentoring program and they wanted them to not get a mentor within the division, they want to go outside of the division and preferably outside of the department, and so my young ones."
A7,823.08,828.75,"Veteran: decided that they didn't want to do it and were you a little ornery but about it."
A7,829.8,831.45,"Veteran: I had a discussion with them."
A7,832.56,850.71,"Veteran: But I it was I my problem, the thing was when I first received that I saw it as a big picture and I understood why the military was trying to get outside of your space, because people get really insular, especially in the military so."
A7,852.18,863.07,"Veteran: When I finally told them Okay, this is big name you right now, our little cog, and what we want to do is, we want to expand your little cog into a larger clock."
A7,863.91,876.9,"Veteran: And when I told them lie, they were going out to outside of the department or the division to work with other senior personnel this they it's."
A7,877.41,883.35,"Veteran: It was when they finally started understanding the big picture and how doing this would actually help them."
A7,883.65,889.62,"Veteran: I had to show them this is how it could help you understand what's going on in the military a little better."
A7,889.86,907.92,"Veteran: How what your position and job in on the ship and actually help in fit in like with engineering who actually run the ship or how being with the cooks how they take care of the people you know, and it was creating that buy in and interest that."
A7,908.7,911.94,"Veteran: stirred the pot, and then so when I was taking it to."
A7,913.08,933.21,"Veteran: To well, they were senior, but they were junior officers and then, explaining to them the same reasoning and why they needed to you know speak with to do in your personnel, and this is how you should interact and whatnot with them there, it was like watching the light bulbs come on."
A7,933.87,935.4,"Veteran: And stuff so it's."
A7,935.61,941.22,"Veteran: yeah so you had it's when you speak with different levels, you have to."
A7,941.91,956.67,"Veteran: find out where the ads are they are with the young ones it's like more big picture, with what how you kind of fit and then with the more senior level, most of them already have the major overview they gotta be remember how."
A7,957.42,973.8,"Veteran: The cogs fitting together and why everybody's important in their own way, so if you're talking with it obviously everybody sees a lot with it, but if you're talking with people just the vendor or one who keeps your soda machines as like that guy he's the one that keeps you right."
A7,974.4,975.99,"Veteran: You know, and just you know."
A7,976.56,988.89,"Veteran: Just reminding people what they do for each other and how everybody can interact creating those that networking, the connection that's when that's when you see all the light bulbs start going on."
Q8,989.58,994.32,"Interviewer: that's great and really quickly, what do you think you're the best candidate for the position."
A8,997.29,1018.05,"Veteran: Is I actually I I see I see I see connections, I see how, when somebody is doing something I can usually see how what this person is doing, I can actually i've gotten a lot better at just reading body language understanding tight shoulders relax back or."
A8,1019.46,1035.45,"Veteran: How people turn and talk to each other i've been I don't know why, but I actually understand a lot about body language, how the direct eye contact how that works is this person receptive to me is are they going to be able to take on board what i'm saying and then."
A8,1035.48,1037.97,"Veteran: What I can do is take that."
A8,1038.3,1052.61,"Veteran: and create this this network and this connection with this person, and then I start that's how I start my team building I find how everybody takes and works, and then I start thinking, then I listened was like okay this person talks like."
BCI,1052.61,1053.09,"Interviewer: This word."

A8,1064.82,1073.28,"Veteran: That likes to be kind of in the front, so I need to, but what knows how to work alone, so I can give you some of the more singular things and then."
A8,1073.55,1087.92,"Veteran: This is the person who's like super super bottom team builder I like to do everything, and you know and so it's i'm one of those people on the team builder I know how to build teams, I know how to put people together, and I know how to get people to each other."
A8,1088.94,1107.45,"Veteran: To me that's really important is to see what they can what people can bring and help people understand, so that way it creates less tension and you get a lot more cross departmental cross cultural interaction and then you just have them a much bigger, better holistic."
A8,1108.05,1109.01,"Veteran: Right well."
