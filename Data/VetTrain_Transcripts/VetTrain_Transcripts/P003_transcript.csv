A1,56.125016,84.278589,"Veteran: So, um, let's see. I'm currently in research right now. Um, I am uh, trying to continue that. I've been in manufacturing for a little while with pharma and biotech and uh. I think what I'm now looking for is something that is, I don't know, more hands on. Something I can kind of have my work be attributed to, be proud of. I find research to be extremely rewarding in that thus far even though I've only been in it for a couple of months. It's really great."
BCI,84.411495,84.878397,"Interviewer: Uh huh."
A1,85.008705,85.805195,"Veteran: Really great"
Q2,86.071591,90.831398,"Interviewer: Good, how much of that did you do when you were bachelors or an undergrad? Did you do a lot of work?"
A2,90.831398,103.726218,"Veteran: I did some, but I didn't, I wasn't apart of too many labs, uh, I just kind of worked side project of the lab, and then, um. If I did contribute in any other reseach, it was kind of outside of that at the Raptor Reserch Program up iin Fort Collins"
BCI,103.878715,104.099196,"Interviewer: Okay."
A2,104.174244,111.160124,"Veteran: , which we just helped detail a bunch of things for them, and whatever study they were doing like light post preference and things like that."
Q3,111.413994,123.410782,"Interviewer: Gotcha, okay. Good. So, what n-, for your next opportunity, when you're done, I guess when are you, when are you going to wrap up your, you Master's? When is that going to be done?"
A3,124.22786,141.905289,"Veteran: I think that, that would probably be in  a couple of years. I really just kind of started and um. There's a lot of things I need to figure out and what I want to do and what I want to accomplish right now. It's kind of getting the basics and making sure I can experiment and have it go the way I want it to, ha."
BCI,142.140263,145.010946,"Interviewer: Just, hey, I'm still trying to figure out what I'm going to do when I grow up, so, "
A3,145.069847,145.674687,"Veteran: Ha ha ha."
Q4,146.321835,149.790745,"Interviewer: right? It's just, it's, it's a, yeah, it's an evolving process. Well good."
Q4,149.985287,163.162299,"Interviewer: So can you tell me about what you did to prepare for our interview today in advance, whether that's just kind of going back to your resume, or doing research, or anything that would help you to, to be ready?"
A4,163.992347,219.877922,"Veteran: Yeah, so what I had starrted with, is I, I kind of reflected on my manufacturing career, I guess. Since I did spin, I was really involved with for example, a Fuji film, uh, I was a team lead there, and I really helped them a lot with their COVID projects, and, and I think that was proabably one of my uh, um, most kind of influential, I guess, like, experiences that I've had that really want to jump outside the box and learn more, and become more of a teacher, rather than just a manufacturing, push-buttons, and, so fourth, and uh. So, then I really reflected on that kind of how the processes were, made sure I understood what I was doing there, and how I helped the flow and got the team together and. That, that was, that was big for me, becuase right now I'm back in the student seat learning, trying to understand, making sure I can do things."
Q5,219.929801,236.452943,"Interviewer: Okay, good. So, I, I don't like asking the quesiton of what are your biggest strengths and weaknesses, right? But what would you think, what would you say are some string points, er, or, a true strength of you, uh, that bring to any position that you'd apply for?"
A5,237.088449,261.432201,"Veteran: Yeah, so I, I would have to say organizational skills and making sure tasks are uh, stayed on, and that they are accoplished, uh. I don't like to feel disorderly, or uh, like I'm out of control, uh, or that the process is out of control and just having that state of really making sure everybody knows what they're doing, and I know what I'm doing, and I'm doing what I can to allow them to do that, that."
Q6,261.432201,279.563562,"Interviewer: So, is, is that, I guess piggy-backing off that, is that something you've always kind of, just been wired to do? Is that something that you learned in the military, or is that just a, you know, just a thing through life's maturity, er, or, you know, where did you pick up that skill?"
A6,280.199067,297.870636,"Veteran: You know, I- sports has always been a big part of my life growing up, that's all I did. I loved sports, but honestly, the military really kind of, drove that home, because it became more of a team effort, and you don't have all the- if not everybody's there then it, you know. You'll need to pick up that slack somewhere. "
BCI,297.967282,298.356367,"Interviewer: Yeah."
A6,298.468003,306.781367,"Veteran: And just having people on the same page, it, it was uh, it helped our processes, I'll say. "
Q7,307.032963,307.953797,"Interviewer: Sure. And-"
BCV,307.953797,309.502707,"Veteran: And um, yeah."
Q7,309.585675,313.984615,"Interviewer: Yeah, okay, so, conversely, what's something that you need to improve on?"
A7,315.424229,330.559635,"Veteran: Improve on? Um, I'd say stepping out of my comfort zone more so. Um, really taking on those projects, getting ready to accept failure, becuase uh, yeah. That would be my biggest thing."
BCI,330.754178,331.856586,"Interviewer: Are you a perfectionist?"
A7,332.252451,334.276862,"Veteran: Ha, I try not to be, but"
BCI,334.326643,334.716591,"Interviewer: Try not to be, yeah."
A7,334.749778,350.039825,"Veteran:  I, I have a hard time uh, for example drafting docuemnts, or writing batch records. If it doesn't look great as I want it to be, or I know it can be improved, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to fidget with that until it can be understood by anybody and everybody."
BCI,350.234367,365.162262,"Interviewer: Yeah, similar, this guy's picking it up. Absolutely, understand. So looking back into wheather it's your military, or just, or you just, your with, with Fuji film, or I think it was Tolmar. Is that right? "
A7,365.330865,366.355456,"Veteran: Yes, yes, Tolmar"
Q8,366.355456,374.565149,"Interviewer: Or, er, a- agian in the military, what do you, what do you, what is your biggest accoplishments, that you're really really proud of in your professional career?"
A8,375.706465,403.08508,"Veteran: Hm, you know, I have to say, going back to Fuji maybe because that's the most relevent and recent, but I think leading a team was one of my favorite things. It was uh, stressful and yet, accoplishing and satisfying, and it's always great when you get someone off the street in the oil field for example and teach them how to, I don't know, understand what's happening back here with all this biology and this crazy equipment and."
Q9,403.253683,405.238017,"Interviewer: Right, good."
Q9,405.497407,422.357757,"Interviewer: And you know, um, I guess, do you remember the steps or anything specific that took you, or how did you become, or how did you get to a position where you're leading a team if eight? Were you, was it, were you hired into that position, did you work your way up? You know or? "
A9,423.019201,432.751225,"Veteran: So it was a, when I started at Fuji, we were, uh doing a lot of viral therapeudics, and uh, we literally opened up the building and downstream, there was four of us, "
BCI,433.044625,433.323702,"Interviewer: Okay."
A9,433.40667,457.81637,"Veteran: and uh, at that point you know, the four of us worked on a project for about a year and we all became pretty proficient at understanding and doing those, and then SARS-COVID two hit and we started doing COVID projects and then basically, I was assigned a gorup of people to, uh, take over shifts, and then just basically leading in that shift training that shift, and getting, you know, the processes going and started."
Q10,458.283272,471.979063,"Interviewer: Okay, great, great. So, w- you're going to be, I'm assuming it's going to be about two years, so you're looking about two years before you move to a different position, when you figure out what it is that you want to do. Is that right?"
BCV,472.277362,473.029593,"Veteran: Yes, yes."
Q10,473.029593,473.963397,"Interviewer: Okay, okay."
Q10,474.67672,487.049623,"Interviewer: So, two, two more questions. Why pick you for this job over another candidate, and I always tell people, not a time to be modest. You know, just. W- why would you be the right person for this job?"
A10,488.385481,529.831731,"Veteran: I would say, um, I guess, I don't have a whole lot of experience, but I do have experience in bringing up, like espeically at a CDMO, which I find is a really interesting workplace, especially when you get a lot of work projects, but being in that at such an early stage, and being with it as it has grown because it literally went from a fifteen person building to maybe a two-hundred-fifty person building, so it grew quickly and there were so many aches along the way with things that were not getting completed as quick as they should, and I think just really understandin that process and how a company grows can grow so rapidly  "
BCI,530.030546,530.536356,"Interviewer: Uh huh."
A10,530.661408,555.120286,"Veteran: was a big thing. Especially, I think, with so here in College Station area where we don't have a whole lot of selection in biotech, uh, or people who are proficient operators, manufacturers, uh, it becomes more important to be able to train and get those people that knowing how to perform a function, so. I think that, that experience alone is uh, pretty strong. Yes."
BCI,555.33404,556.332692,"Interviewer: Sets you apart."
A10,556.514143,556.879201,"Veteran: Yes"
Q11,557.011949,558.18733,"Interviewer: Okay, great."
Q11,558.602354,570.326782,"Interviewer: And then, do you have any concerns moving into your next role? Or anything that you're nervous about, or feel that you're, an- any kind of, I guess are you anxious about, you know, what that's going to be?"
A11,571.325434,592.854803,"Veteran: Yeah, uh, I think knowing who you're working with just kind of getting personalities, uh, yeah, there's always a little nervousness there. Uh, just trying to, you know, I guess, fit in and also making sure that your working style works with their working style, and yet ya'll can come up with something that's reproducable, so yeah, there's"
IRR,593.762668,676.817308,"Interviewer: Yeah, nope, totally understand, but you know, I look at in reference to military or going to Colorado, and moving to A and M, and doing what you're doing now and coming out of a COVID year, it sounds like you are very adaptable, you're very personable, um, so, I, when that time comes, I, I am confident. Other than knowing you for fifteen minutes that, that you'll be just fine, so, um, that's all the questions, for kind of the mock interview, but, uh, in reference to when that time comes, or if have questions, you know in reference to how do I make my resume better, or any of that stuff, it's what I've been doing for twelve years. I was in law enforcement for six years, I'm from a military family, I'm married to an Aggie family, um, so, uh, but please don't hesitiate, if there's anything I can do, it will be objective feedback, you know, becuase my whole goal is to help people to get opportunities, right? So, um, I, what I'll, what I'd, I'm going to do is with some of the, I, I won't get it done this week, but I'm going to add my comments to resumes and I'll send that to you because I think that's important, if that's allowed, im, because, it's just a, it's a matter of time before that two years is up and then you're looking, you know?  "
IRR,677.364066,678.84172,"Veteran: Yes, definitely. That sounds fantastic."
IRR,679.089009,687.271238,"Interviewer: Okay, yep. Again, everybody has their opinion, mine's going off twelve years of experience, of this works, you know what I mean?"
IRR,687.687788,690.411383,"Interviewer: So, well good. Do you have any questions for me?"
IRR,691.928814,693.078977,"Veteran: I don't think so, um."
IRR,693.109039,693.459215,"Interviewer: Okay."
IRR,693.86127,695.659272,"Veteran: This, this was fun, actually. This was nice. "
IRR,695.677,697.868845,"Interviewer: Well, I appreciate you"
IRR,698.348717,709.645151,"Interviewer: Well, yeah. This is an evolving process, but I appreciate it Carlos. It was a pleasure meeitng you. I appreciate your service too and um, best of luck with uh, the research and uh, the Master's, and I'll be in touch, okay?"
IRR,709.904541,710.981467,"Veteran: Thank you, thank you very much."
