A8,956.71,969.37,"Veteran: Physical test scores, and all of that so meeting their goals and I had one very problematic marine he was just a jokester and he was a rascal and."
A8,970.21,977.71,"Veteran: Well, he wanted to deploy he wanted to deploy more than anything in the world and during those months that's how I kept to motivate it."
A8,978.07,994.6,"Veteran: was like hey I talked to gunny one of our one of my bosses they had talked to him, he said, you need to do X and y you need to get your pull ups to 23 and you need to be able to tell me how to disassemble this truck and he said okay."

A8,1012.78,1025.05,"Veteran: i'd be like you, you worked your butt off for me, and it would not be ethical as me as a leader not return the favor so breaking it down on a ground level and being."
A8,1026.82,1042.57,"Veteran: Not angry, but disappointed when when it's when it's failures come because you have that personal relationship and you're like man i'm i'm working i'm trying to work for you, but you're not going to work for me and and that's that's."
A8,1043.59,1048.51,"Veteran: During those three months during those horrible conditions that was enough to motivate them."
A8,1049.47,1055.41,"Veteran: And there were a lot of unmotivated people going around and there were a lot toxic behavior and that's."
A8,1056.13,1069.72,"Veteran: One of the reasons they gave me the achievement medal is because my guys stayed out of trouble that's they did their job that's all that that would that was asked, and so yeah probably a longer answer you hope for, but."
Q9,1071.25,1080.97,"Interviewer: But it is it's tough when things are tough to keep people motivated and it sounds like you've kind of found some secret sauce secret sauce there and making sure you figure out what."
Q9,1081.6,1086.49,"Interviewer: People need and what they want and being able to use that to motivate them said that's awesome."

A9,1107.43,1128.43,"Veteran: The biggest challenge I faced with the small rifle ammunition was a little particular because of the nature of the high explosives there's a there's a compound in the each primer that ignites the gunpowder in the round, so that tiny little compound when you're making."
A9,1129.48,1144.39,"Veteran: Excuse me 60,000 an hour is you've got to have 10,000 pound batches so it's very, very explosive and you have to find a gat blast proof building or make a blast proof building, which is pretty expensive."
A9,1145.98,1148.98,"Veteran: But the the number one."
A9,1150.09,1156.36,"Veteran: issue I ran into with the manufacturing was scalability."
A9,1157.62,1173.37,"Veteran: I could hire a team of 10 people and have them make by hand one primer every five minutes or I can purchase these machines for a whole lot of money because there's only one company that makes."
A9,1174.39,1182.49,"Veteran: And I can purchase these machines and make up to 60,000 primers now and that's what browning and all the."

Q10,1237.09,1243.12,"Interviewer: To make sure that you don't have waste and then make sure that it's still high quality and the same, I think that those are challenges that."
Q10,1243.740606,1256.32,"Interviewer: Umm A lot of folks face in this industry, and I think that you've got to experience one piece of it, it sounds like you might have found the potentially a niche in the middle there that you might be able to find an answer to."
BCV,1258.93,1260.218381,"Veteran: know hahaha."
Q10,1261.06,1269.67,"Interviewer: awesome well and I don't know if he's gonna come in and yell at me for going over time again, but like i'm going to just kind of curious because you talked about like a lot with your leadership style and I know you were able to hone that."

A10,1302.67,1318.3,"Veteran: which I know is is is just everyone wants that and and it is very generally unrealistic, but I did have the fortune of having a couple lieutenants that took that approach."
A10,1318.69,1330.63,"Veteran: And it took a period of time to build up their trust to because it takes a tremendous amount of trust to say here's my vision here's the mission go do it and it took."
A10,1331.59,1335.94,"Veteran: Months maybe six to eight months to build up that level of trust, but once I had it."
A10,1336.84,1352.74,"Veteran: They knew they didn't have to waste any time with telling me how to do it, I was going to do it in a weird way that they knew for sure it was it was not going to be seen before, but it was going to be the most efficient and the people that the team like this."
A10,1354.45,1372.18,"Veteran: And yeah that's that that is my favorite style and also, in my opinion, the style that reflects trust up and down I trust you, you know to deliver a good product, and so I appreciate that."
