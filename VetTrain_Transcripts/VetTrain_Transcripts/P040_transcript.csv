A3,453.748094,483.160731,"Veteran: Um! But there are companies that do tend to uh skirt around things or push the push boundaries.

A4,567.30967,575.537735,"Veteran: Well, I think the the three, the three things that I always focused as a leader in the marines were, were mine, were morale,"
A4,576.312391,592.426762,"Veteran: mission and or the you know, morale, mission and marine. So first office is, take care of the marines. To take care of your people, you know, as leaders. That's our job. And yes, we have a uh responsibility to"
