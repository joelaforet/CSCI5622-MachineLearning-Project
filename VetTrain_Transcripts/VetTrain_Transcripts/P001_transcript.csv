IRR,0,0.51438,"Veteran: How are you?"
Q1,0.916434,24.102642,"Interviewer: Good. I just uh, I uh, always have, it's an ongoing joke, that I uh, I married into an Aggie family and so, ha ha. I'm up here in Kansas City, but they're all, they're all up here with me, so I was supposed to say ""Gig  em'"", whatever that means. I don't know, but yeah. Well good, well I appreciate you taking the time to, to visit with me today. Just had some questions to run through with you, and, and we'll go from there if that sounds okay, alright?"

Q1,25.065643,29.187827,"Interviewer: So, I, other than, you know, you can only put so much information into a resume, right? Or "
BCV,29.262342,29.546258,"Veteran: Right."
Q1,29.622619,31.910007,"Interviewer: else, it would be four, five, pages long, but."
BCV,31.991356,32.990007,"Veteran: That's about my age."
Q1,33.379093,45.012734,"Interviewer: Right, exactly, well, and I have a very similar background too. I spent many years in law enforcement, so, uh, you know, tell me about, tell me about yourself and kinda what you're looking for uh, you know, um."
Q1,45.272124,48.799828,"Interviewer: Are you looking to get out of law enforcement, into a different position?"
A1,49.240791,85.192245,"Veteran: Um, I'm, I'm pretty far down the road in my career in law enforcement, um, the uh, the current climate has made me decide to take a different avenue. Um, I'm within, uh, five years of retirement. So, I'm, my plan is to retire, um, once I have my master's degree, and uh, hopefully go follow up wife's footsteps into uh, teaching and that way we can have summers off and go, and you know, have a beautiful life together, so."
BCI,85.296001,88.317895,"Interviewer: Yeah, escape the, the heat and humidity down there, right?"
A1,88.317895,88.655102,"Veteran: Yeah."
Q2,88.849644,90.25035,"Interviewer: Okay, good deal."
Q2,90.613496,96.397893,"Interviewer: Yep, I understand about the, how the climate's changed and ah, ah I get that. It's a conversation for another time, but"
BCV,96.644314,97.111216,"Veteran: Yeah, right."
Q2,97.111216,108.083413,"Interviewer: So, tell me about your, your interview process. Or, have you started interviewing with other companies, or are you waiting to get done with your Master's before you start that process?"
A2,108.550315,146.615797,"Veteran: Um, I've put in a few applications, um, I've had two interviews. One was with a high school, um, I didn't realize that um, once you were uh hired by the school they had to take, you know, a certain about of your, your uh, your salary, so they can pay for your teaching certificate and all that kind of stuff and that really brought the amount of income down a lot, so I turned that one down, and uh, the other one was with, was with Sysco Foods, and uh, they just went in a different direction "
Q3,147.147547,164.340415,"Interviewer: Okay, so with all of your experience, military as well as law enforcement, what are the. It's not, you know, tell me something good about you, and tell me some of the good about you. What are the strenghts you think are transferrable from what you, from your career to teaching?"
A3,165.590175,218.700278,"Veteran: Uh, when I say discipline, I mean there's a, uh, structure to the teaching world. There's a, you know, you're going to do this this day, this this day, and it's this day, which what made me go into the military has structure. Um, when I was growing up as a kid, I didn't have a lot of structure. Um, my parents divorced when I was twelve, and I was pretty much left to my own devices after hours becuase my mom worked the evening shift, so when I got out of high school, I could do whatever I wanted to do. Um, and I needed, I knew if I didn't do better I would probably not be anywhere close to where I am today. So I sought out the military for the structure, and uh, I found out to be a, a pleasing enviornment for me."
Q4,219.491418,223.82323,"Interviewer: So, was that an easy transition from the military to law enforcement becuase of that chain of command?"
A4,224.62734,246.753307,"Veteran: Um, that's what brought me back to law enforcement. I went into the business world where it's kind of ch- chaoitic and you know, people that haven't been in the military, or in law enforcement don't realize when somebody is looking for structure, you know, drastic change doesn't help, you know?"
BCI,246.753307,247.025666,"Interviewer: Yeah."
A4,247.829775,270.461553,"Veteran: And, that's the reason once I got laid off, um, that was a drastic change hard to, hard to cope with, uh, getting laid off for not doing anything wrong, uh, so I sought out law enforcement because it's government fund- you know, it, crime's never going to go away, and it is para-military, so it has its structure, so."
Q5,270.837668,286.037922,"Interviewer: So when we're talking about strengths, what is, what do you think there's an area you need to improve when if you need to go into- what's something you can improve before your next opportunity? If that makes sense?"
A5,286.647489,328.694607,"Veteran: Um, probably uh, just interaction with customers, not, not with, whenever I have to deal with somebody it's usually on a, on a, you know, jovial basis, you know, and, and, so for the last sixteen years I've went into it in a, you know, stern, until things change, or until, I know that I feel safe, um, so going into, back into the civilian world, having to change my mindset would be a very difficult task for me."
BCI,328.811333,344.413642,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, and it's, it is, I was there, you know, and it sticks with you, but, but you can get through it, you know? There's stuff that you just, will never leave you which is a good, the good stuff, right? but, um, it just takes time so, okay."
A5,344.413642,350.424057,"Veteran: Because, I'm a type A personality whenever I come on seeing things go the way I want them to go. "
BCI,350.535246,350.802138,"Interviewer: Yep, yep."
A5,350.896658,353.467606,"Veteran: And if it doesn't go that way, that's bad for you. You know what I mean?"
Q6,353.609017,362.804392,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, no, I get it, I get it, so what do you think is your biggest, in your professioanl career, what's you biggest achievement? What's something you're the most proud of?"
A6,364.68497,406.174401,"Veteran: In my professional career? Um, I am the first and only, uh, technology person for the Waller County Sheriff's office. I a- I am the sheriff's go to guy when it comes to technology. I do all their forensic, um, downloads for thier phones. Um, I'm trying to put together a forensic lab there at the sheriff's office. Um, so just growing the technology for the sheriff's office has been my biggest goal and we just didn't have that before and now you have a DA's office that depends on me and those kind of things, so."
Q7,406.770998,407.74371,"Interviewer: So how did you-"
Q7,408.301399,414.22846,"Interviewer: What, what kind of steps did you take to get that position, or was it something that you just inherited, or how did that work?"
A7,414.682392,443.085598,"Veteran: Becuase I kind of backed into it. Um, I uh, ah, my previous sheriff who passed away in August, um, fired me, one, for my technical skills, but two, becuase I was a police officer, but he needed someone at the office that he could rely on to give him a straight answers. Not from people trying to sell him stuff."
BCI,443.254201,443.630317,"Interviewer: Right."
A7,444.784602,516.70048,"Veteran: And uh, we, I did that for several years and I approached him, uh, one day, I said ""Look, uh, I know you're, you want to move this sheriff's office forward, what do you think about this?"" And it was to go to a forensic class and get my forensic certification. Uh, to be uh, CCFE, and uh, he agreed to it and I had no degree, I had no certificates, I just, I just knew what I knew, and I went to the class, and I, I got certified. Um, but ah, I dressed the courts about becoming a professional, or uh, um, I don't know what they call them. A professional witness I guess. And they said ""You need something in your background, and I, just telling me you're, you know these things and getting a certification isn't enough. You need to, need to go to school"". And this was from a district judge, so I, we got along well. He's an ex-army guy, you know, military, military guy to military guy and he said: ""You need to go get some education"", so that's where I went."
Q8,517.063625,522.212517,"Interviewer: Okay. Good. So, are you and your wife willing to stay around College Station"
A8,523.392741,538.878324,"Veteran: Um, at the moment, yes. Um, her mother, uh is getting up into her late seventies, um. She doesn't want to leave and leave her by herself, so once she passes, I think we'll be able to go anywhere we want to go but."
BCI,539.033959,541.563011,"Interviewer: Okay, but for, okay. So when-"
A8,541.563011,543.080443,"Veteran: We're just waiting on her, so."
Q9,543.080443,552.587086,"Interviewer: Sure. Yeah. So, when, ah, when are you expecting to finish your - it, what, we're looking at, yeah, your, ah, um, when are you going to be done with school?"
BCV,553.144775,554.195304,"Veteran: Twety-twenty three"
Q9,554.597359,557.42471,"Interviewer: Okay, so, that's when you want to make the move?"
BCV,557.42471,558.047246,"Veteran: Right, right."
Q9,558.047246,558.96808,"Interviewer: So, you've got some time."
Q9,560.368786,580.471511,"Interviewer: Um, I guess one of the questions I would ask is ""If I was, you know, the uh school district, or you're wanting to work for. Why Would, why would I hire you versus other poeple? Why are you the right person for the job?"" So this is, this is a time for you to not be modest"
A9,580.899505,647.122853,"Veteran: Ha ha, um, a lot, a lot of uh, instructors, they go to college, they get, you know, some time in, in school, they go back and get their degrees, and then, you know, they never experience life. I, I bring the education part of it too with my, my degrees and my, you know, my, you know, accomplishments, both, law enforcement and civilian, and that's where I think I beat them. I have military experience, I have civilian fortune 500 company experience, and I've been in, I've been to school. I mean, I've got, I'm, I'm going to have a Master's degree at that, so I can relate to every section of life at this point in time. It's to where I'm at, I mean, I'm obviously not elderly, so I can't, I can't talk to that. I have, you know, I have a, I have a, a, a very extensive life to include almost include dying, so, that's, that's, "
BCI,647.199589,648.081515,"Interviewer: I've been there."
A9,648.238191,649.845034,"Veteran: I had stage four cancer "
BCI,649.936153,650.506811,"Interviewer: Oh."
A9,650.582291,669.807692,"Veteran: in 2016, umm and yeah, I was on the verge of death and I beat that thing and I realize that life is too short  and I always said I would go back to school one day, and it took almost, uh, dying to do it."
BCI,669.935122,673.151558,"Interviewer: Will, I'm glad to hear that you, you beat that, that's amazing"
A9,673.735186,679.675217,"Veteran: So, that's, I mean, when kids, if kids ask me questions, I think I have the life experience to answer them."
Q10,680.232905,696.691201,"Interviewer: Yeah, I think that that is justified. Yeah, for sure. Well, last qustion is do you have any concerns about the next step in your career, right? Other than, or, or, maybe it's compensation, or you know, what you're alluding to, but what are you concerned with? "
A10,698.26051,758.270387,"Veteran: My age. Um, I'm like I said, I'm getting my degrees later in life. Um, I, I, I would like to think that I'm still young enough to compete with the twenty-something year olds, that I just know it's just not, not realistic, um. Um, I'm to the point in my life where I want to get to the retirement, so that I have a, a solid financial background when I'm done, and then a can go do what I want. So, um, with my Master's degree with a Master's in jurisprudence and cybersecurity, I feel that I can be an asset to a company and, with my mili-, my military-police background, my law enforcement background, and then my, my Master's degree, I can provide some valid, and valuable, uh, knowledge to a company regarding those, those areas, so. "

IRR,767.284189,767.712183,"Veteran: Ah"
IRR,768.075329,779.715739,"Veteran: No, I, I, I, I've always been a, trying to help kids out. I have, I've had seven foreign exchange students. I saw this come up, said they need veterans to"
IRR,780.136963,780.539018,"Interviewer: Yeah."
IRR,780.623133,784.044763,"Veteran:  to uh, assist in their education, so here I am. "
IRR,784.468777,794.597956,"Interviewer: Well, good. Well, I will somehow hopefully, if it's, if it's doable, get you my information, because with that transition, I've done it, and I help people all the time. I'd love to help you if I can."
