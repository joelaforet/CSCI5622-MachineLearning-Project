A3,208.909631,224.113799,"Veteran: -and expertise. Um, so if I'm taking it down, to like that smaller level, I would say that um, I have recruited people, um, and, it-it essentially it's, as far as recruiting for those positions, it's-it's essentially just based on their-"
A3,224.490762,233.537871,"Veteran: -um, experience. Um, how- their work ethic, and things like that. It's um- and every project or team that I've recruited for in the past-"

BCV,269.600651,278.622629,"Veteran: Um, I think it's human indentify-I-ID, or uh, people's like, personal information? I belive that's what that hits on."
BCV,281.085453,287.493821,"Veteran: Cause I know in my role, um, dealing with the hospital, you're dealing with a lot of people's information, um-"

BCV,303.728355,306.316833,"Veteran: So yeah, I think that's, that's what they're hitting at."
Q4,308.000601,316.545092,"Interviewer: Uh, then I guess the question an interview woud probably ask you, is ""what steps have you taken, what steps can you concieve to protect the HID""."

A5,398.220378,406.312514,"Veteran: Um, but, you know, uh, again, kind of breaking it down, um, like [inaudible] a problem, or situation that they have or-"
A5,406.538691,419.129251,"Veteran: -um, the futures- goals they wanna achieve, and, just kinda building a pathway, and hopefully at the end- at the end of- right course of action that they [inaudible] in the military."

Q6,443.355397,448.934447,"Interviewer: Yep, oh I- here's-here's one that they're going to ask you, but I already know the answer, because I'm from the military as well."

Q7,477.307185,481.629693,"Interviewer: Here's something that I'll ask. Change managment- what change management systems do you have experience with?"
A7,483.89147,485.9522,"Veteran: Oh, um, so uh-"
A7,490.123922,493.667373,"Veteran: -almost rudimentary change managment, you know-"
A7,494.371037,499.196162,"Veteran: -process, there's nothing- there's no particular, um-"
A7,500.251658,509.499813,"Veteran: -program. Um, it's usually someone new, or someone from- has a different base, or a different part of the, uh-"
A7,509.826514,517.717603,"Veteran: -the Air Force, or Texas A&M come in, they have fresh new ideas, and then solely start implementing them in order to change it."
A7,518.094566,527.041151,"Veteran: Um, and then, at that point, once that idea or process is brought in, um, you- uh, change it."
BCI,527.719685,537.344803,"Interviewer: And-and I'm sorry for the ""wow"", it's just that it- my brain went somewhere entirely different, cause I- my background is IT, and that word has an entirely different meaning in the IT world. [laughs]"
A7,537.772027,545.637986,"Veteran: Well, I mean, so, I'll be honest with you, so I'm working on an MBA- first time I heard about change management was about 3 weeks ago, so I think I hit it on the head with that one. Uh-"
A7,546.06521,559.459957,"Veteran: I know it's just um, essentially goes along with just, um, adjusting to change. Uh, you know, it comes down to what a supervisor needs to, or a leader, and uh, for this matter-"
A7,559.811789,567.878794,"Veteran: Um, the uh- leader, or person that's in that role needs to understand their people's strenghts, weaknesses- those people's uh, "
A7,568.582458,572.72905,"Veteran: -hesitat-hesitation to be changed, and why they're hesitant to that change."
A7,573.281929,577.302866,"Veteran: Um, it's-it's like a big schmorgasboard of things to look at."
A7,577.529043,583.862019,"Veteran: I know- I think- from like, a human resources, my current position, it's not as high, I would say-"
A7,584.088197,587.807564,"Veteran: -so I kinda think I kinda went in there with a little bit different of a perspective."
A7,587.807564,594.416979,"Veteran: But if you're going from a leadership mentor, that's a lot of different aspects, a lot of different um-"
A7,595.748915,600.574039,"Veteran: -areas you need to look at, in order to ensure that change management is successful."
BCI,601.428489,613.114337,"Interviewer: Yeah-yeah, in IT it's a very formalized system, with ""these are the changes we're making to this system, here's the scripts to roll them foward, here's the script to roll it back if we have any issues""- it-it's a very formalized, regimented process-"
BCI,613.742609,621.859875,"Interviewer: -and we actually have different change management systems in which you can put in all this information, and they can- the system can automatically roll it forward or roll it back."
A7,623.041026,631.133162,"Veteran: I noticed that uh, the research that I've done for my classes- every time I put in change management, a lot of IT sources comes up."
BCI,631.711171,632.188658,"Interviewer: Mm-hmm."
A7,632.364574,644.301731,"Veteran: I don't need it for IT, I kinda need it for project management, and you like- you have the project scope stuff like that, you can [inaudible]- your change management processes outlined in that, so I mean it's kind of, kind of-"
A7,646.010629,648.046229,"Veteran: I mean, it's a broad question, but-"
BCI,648.046229,659.882862,"Interviewer: It is, and it's just- it's just so funny because that- that word hit me, and I asked you about systems you'd use, and then you start talking about stuff other than systems, and I'm just like, ""wow, ok, yeah""- do- the two terms are totally divorced."
A7,660.159302,666.215838,"Veteran: And I think what- and I don't even know if they're truly divorced, I think, in a lot of ways, they're probably a lot similar, but-"
A7,666.84411,670.563477,"Veteran: - as far as IT side, I mean I'm IT illiterate."
BCI,670.915309,674.810591,"Interviewer: I'm sure IT side is much much more regimented than the human resources side of it. "
A7,675.0619,675.539386,"Veteran: Right, yes."
BCI,675.840957,687.551936,"Interviewer: Human resources, you're dealing more with the people, how can you get people to change, how can you get people to accept the changes that are going on, and listen to their questions and queries about, maybe the change isn't the best thing."
A7,688.280731,698.885953,"Veteran: Absolutely, absolutely, I mean, like you said, you can come up with a different idea on something, and you know, me as a smaller level human resources person might have tried something similar to that-"
A7,699.061869,715.371795,"Veteran: -and have x,y,z- why it doesn't work, you know. So um, so yeah, like I said, it- through research, I do notice that change managment does come up a lot as an IT [inaudible]-specific [inaudible]- like I specifically have to go in, and go project management."
Q8,718.412629,731.530936,"Interviewer: Ok, and according to local, regional, global policies, uh- has there been any policies- passed down, uh, in a job, that you had a problem with, and how did you resolve that issue?"
A8,733.290096,742.990607,"Veteran: Um, so, coming from the military, it's either, you typically don't have issues with it, if you do you get over it, it's like kinda-"
A8,743.66914,752.46494,"Veteran: -bring that into everything I kinda do. Let's say you're paying me to do something, I try to leave my personal beliefs, and-"
A8,753.545567,758.697393,"Veteran: -differences ouf of the workplace, uh, if I ab-absolutely have an issue with it-"
A8,758.898439,766.337173,"Veteran: -um, this never happens, but I think- I would like to think that I would move on, or try to find a different focus somewhere that-"
A8,766.563351,781.063855,"Veteran: -went along with my ideals a little bit more. However, um, openly bad-mouthing, or um, is not really my uh I guess, course of action."
A8,781.063855,782.596838,"Veteran: What was the last part of that question too?"
BCI,783.727726,791.216722,"Interviewer: I Oh, I said, uh, if-if there's been any policies that you've been, uh, dislike to- that you'd have to pass down, you know, how would you resolve those issues?"
BCI,791.870124,793.855462,"Interviewer: And you pretty much covered that with-"
BCI,794.936089,797.172735,"Interviewer: -accept it, or I'll have to find work elsewhere."
A8,797.398913,803.656496,"Veteran: Yeah, I mean it's- it's a simple- like you know, obvious-obviously I- I'm in the military, government side, so it's not that simple-"
BCI,804.033459,805.164347,"Interviewer: No it's not."
A8,805.465918,810.291042,"Veteran: You know, so it's like uh, you kinda deal with it and, uh-"
A8,811.472193,817.000981,"Veteran: You- I don't know, there's, I don't- there's really not a second option, other than prison. Um-"
A8,817.151766,826.676361,"Veteran: -so, uh, or dishonorable discharge. So, uh-the-the civilian side, I'm still new to it, um, but I- I would like to assume that I either have a-"
A8,827.656465,836.301479,"Veteran: -somewhat of a say, in it, or I could just move on, if it was that, um-"
A8,837.809331,845.826074,"Veteran: -going against my personal beliefs that much. But I don't- I haven't ran into anything that crazy, so yeah- "
