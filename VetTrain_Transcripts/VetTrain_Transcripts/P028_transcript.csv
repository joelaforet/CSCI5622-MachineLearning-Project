Q3,115.32,130.47,"Interviewer: So obviously looking at your resume I can see, you know you've had a lot of experience working in a team environment, can you tell me about a time when you built strong relationships, where none previously existed and what was the outcome of that."
A3,132.12,134.97,"Veteran: So I would say that that would be where."
A3,134.992571,135.608773,"Veteran: Um."
A3,137.82,144.96,"Veteran: When I took over as a as a platoon sargeant or actually as a drill sergeant well I did time as a drill sergeant in a."

Q5,219.18,229.14,"Interviewer: Okay yeah that that makes sense, and so what would you say is like your guiding principle or your philosophy when it comes to leadership."
A5,230.58,239.88,"Veteran: So my my philosophy is to be a good leader, you have to be willing to get out there and do the job that you expect those that you need."
A5,240.96,263.1,"Veteran: To do and understand that job you can't just say that that person or that team needs to do a job, you have to be willing to get out there and do that job with them to get them to work for you, that way whenever it's time to ask them to when it's time to ask or tell them to do things."
A5,263.323714,264.129207,"Veteran: Uh."
A5,264.6,269.88,"Veteran: Then it's it's a they want to do them and it's not that they're told to do them."
Q6,275.97,284.04,"Interviewer: And how would you say you've seen you know people reporting to you um react to your leadership style."
A6,285.27,286.08,"Veteran: So."

A6,288.93,291.9751,"Veteran: How they react my leadership style is."
A6,292.26,294.51,"Veteran: It was a noticeable change from."
A6,295.56,301.826279,"Veteran: The previous uh leadership that they had and the the uh."
A6,303.18,308.52,"Veteran: The work ethic, and the outcome of the work was better quality is better quality work, and it was done."
A6,309.043497,318.9,"Veteran: Uh correctly, the first time and in and within the time standard or the time allotted to get the stuff to get the job done."
A6,319.386027,320.513717,"Veteran: Um uh."
A6,320.7,328.56,"Veteran: And made it more more fun, because then you're interacting with your your subordinates and your workers."
A6,329.051943,329.801051,"Veteran: Uh."
A6,330.24,331.11,"Veteran: And your soldiers."
A6,332.16,339.15,"Veteran: And they get to see you struggle with the same things that they struggle with potentially and it makes them want to work harder."
Q7,343.5,345.45,"Interviewer: Definitely that makes sense okay."
Q7,346.95,347.94,"Interviewer: And so kind of."
Q7,349.47,361.02,"Interviewer: From you know teamwork and leadership to communication can you think of a time where you had to communicate the same information, so you had to deliver the same message."
Q7,361.44,377.1,"Interviewer: But to different audiences and how did you vary your style for those different audiences so maybe you were speaking to a peer group versus superiors versus potentially subordinates or you know contractors civilians, how did you kind of tailor that communication."
A7,378.15,391.32,"Veteran: So that's a good question one you have to understand who you're communicating with and what level of understanding they have of the the."
A7,392.07,405.54,"Veteran: way you're communicating uh are they the in the the banking world are they the CEO or are they the the Teller at the at the bank counter you know how do you how do you communicate."
A7,406.02,424.44,"Veteran: Effectively, and what words, do you use to get your point across what keywords would would make sense to someone, that is not in the the hierarchy uh up high or down mid level or starting out so."
A7,425.49,429.09,"Veteran: Really, you kind of have to engage your audience and as you're."
A7,431.04,445.68,"Veteran: interacting with them, you can chew off of their body language or how they respond to what you're saying, if you can, if you're able to take it up a notch or bring it down and bring it down to a little bit lower level potentially."
A7,446.76,448.05,"Veteran: If that makes sense."
BCI,451.26,463.05,"Interviewer: yeah and can you think of like a specific example where you have to do that, and maybe you know, like what the situation was and then what action you took and how you kind of tailor that message."
A7,463.8,471.03,"Veteran: So yeah so you know kind of like a relating back to being a drill sergeant and showing someone how to."
A7,471.583928,472.389421,"Veteran: Uh."
A7,473.82,481.95,"Veteran: How to read a map, you know you have to read a certain way to ensure that you get the."
A7,483.81,502.98,"Veteran: The grid or the coordinates correct so as opposed to someone that did not know how to read the map, without training versus a a peer where you could just tell them hey, this is the grid coordinates that we're going to you don't have to."
A7,504.6,518.58,"Veteran: You can just tell them the grid coordinates and they understand what you're talking about, as opposed to someone just coming into the military or it could be cub scouts, for that matter, and teaching teaching your child how to read a map."
A7,519.011355,519.784628,"Veteran: Uh."
A7,520.356528,527.04,"Veteran: or whatever you have to goes back to knowing your audience and what they can can understand."
A7,529.2,545.22,"Veteran: The outcome is is they, they were able to figure out there, and you were able to teach them how to use the to read the map and and then apply it in a situation where you give them coordinate or give them coordinates and they have to go out and find."
A7,545.769832,559.17,"Veteran: Uh a assigned as a letter number combination when it come back basically a hands on test, uh and they have a certain standard that they would have to meet to to be able to pass."
Q8,562.68,563.46,"Interviewer: Okay yeah got it."
Q8,564.6,567.66,"Interviewer: I definitely am not someone who's good at reading maps so."
Q8,568.65,572.04,"Interviewer: I would be someone who you'd really have to to walk through."
Q8,572.383321,573.277418,"Interviewer: Um."
Q8,574.2,590.46,"Interviewer: And so kind of another question more on like your adaptability, can you describe a time where you had to change your approach towards attacks or just in general, based upon feedback that you had received."
A8,592.65,594.703532,"Veteran: This uh is."
A8,595.29,598.110767,"Veteran: Once i've had uh."

A8,601.783815,602.500704,"Veteran: Uh."
A8,603.84,614.01,"Veteran: The approach certain approaches do not work, and you have you have to figure out what approach works with with an array."

A8,617.064017,617.788961,"Veteran: Uh."
A8,617.94,625.457254,"Veteran: For an organization, so I would say that was when I went from being a uh."
A8,626.73,633.21,"Veteran: platoon sergeant and being in charge of a smaller group of soldiers to a."
A8,634.374062,641.85,"Veteran: Uh company first sergeant having a larger group uh that approaches a lot different because you."

A8,648.51,666.69,"Veteran: Being interactive changes from being every day, you see, see those those soldiers and go from being having having 40 to 130 it's kind of hard to have a personal relationship with all of them, that you try to."
A8,667.455659,668.180602,"Veteran: Um."
A8,669.12,674.22,"Veteran: But the approach is is is getting to know them and how you can."
