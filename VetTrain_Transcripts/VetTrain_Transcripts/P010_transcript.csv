IRR,0.215714,1.976298,"Interviewer: Hi <NAME>, how are you?"
IRR,2.244213,4.617174,"Veteran: Excellent, how are you?"
IRR,4.617174,120.854011,"Interviewer: Good, good, so, um, if we were in a real interview situation, um, um, I'd basically introduce myself, which I'll do and then I would go forward, and it looks like you've had a, ah, had previous work experience, so I'm sure you've seen this before, where I'll explain the interview process and just the expectations and then give your the opportinity to repond to the questions and then ask your own questions, and at the end, well just let you, uh, sell me on why you're the best cadidate for this position, so I'd like to jump in my name is Barbara Coats, I am the manager of Team Member Engagement at <NAME>, which um, because we are ladies, I can just say this, the fairy godmother of all things, right? That's that's basically that my job title. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I am retired Navy Chief, spent ten years at the CSX railroad before I came to Haskell, um, so I have worked in the field and I have worked in the offices. So, for our interview practice is what I'd first like to do is going to be three parts. The first part is um, one of the things their team and I, I said was for you to look at a job posting. If you didn't get the opportunity to do that I just kind of want you to think of a job posting that you might have read and that might be at Haskell. But the first thing I'm going to ask you to do is, tell me why you think you want to work at Haskell Second thing I'm going to ask you to do is relate your job experience to that fo-job posting. And then, I'll give you the opportunity to ask questions about Haskell, about the work enviornment whatever you feel is important to you to make this decision, to join our team, and then again, I'll give you that opportunity to sell yourself as the best candidate. So, does that sounds a acceptable to you as a job, uh, description for this interview?"
IRR,120.854011,131.45579,"Veteran: Ha, um, yeah, I, I think I'm a little unprepared bec, um, I want, I am just not prepared. I didn't sort of research Haskell and I'm not really sure."
IRR,131.685431,132.680544,"Interviewer: I get that."
IRR,132.757091,133.560836,"Veteran: Okay."
IRR,133.560836,187.137253,"Interviewer: I get that, so, my experience with this process is, is like if you were at US Pathfinders, like I would have communicated with you these expectations. I realize that since we are using, working with the university, that there may have been a gap in communication, so I am fine with winging it and that cheif in me is going to coach a little bit to the side, um, and, um, just, uh, uh background, my boss is a West Point grad, um, she is phenominal, she went to Columbia, um, business school, so she and I talk Navy, Army all the time. Um, I also worked for the USACBRNS in Fort Leonard Wood. So, I, I did a lot of online learning for, for the Army. I designed a lot of lessons for AKO, so, I, I can kind of follow along with you, so we're there. "
IRR,187.273432,187.871034,"Veteran: Okay."
IRR,188.008799,189.724655,"Interviewer: We're pretending. We're practicing. "
IRR,189.75189,191.813212,"Veteran: Alright, pretend, let's, let's pretend."
IRR,192.195948,211.309034,"Interviewer: There you go, most, most good compnies that you go to will explain the interview process to you before you show up and when you sit down and it's our job as interviewer to make you feel comfortable in the position. If you are sitting across from a bunch of jerks, it's not your place, it's not your job. Ha ha ha ha ha."
IRR,211.363506,212.978497,"Veteran: Yeah for sure."
IRR,213.43778,216.143391,"Interviewer: Okay, that's just me to you, ha ha ha."
IRR,216.197862,217.954572,"Veteran: Right, got it."
Q1,218.221976,228.211379,"Interviewer: So, um, again, so Jacqueline, tell me a little bit about what attracted you to the Haskell company and what we do as as design, build firm, and construction."
A1,229.168218,271.690156,"Veteran: Well, personally, um, I grew up aro, around residential construction growing up, so I've always you know, been really attracted to work sites and um, you know, superintendents, foreman, and how everything comes together, how all of the pieces, there, there's always, um, it's like a puzzle, you know, and there's always a moving wheel of many things that are going on, but at the ultimate, you know, um, end of the day, it is a beautiful product. So, um, I'd like to be a part of that puzzle and, and figure out how all these meeting pieces sort of fit together to create a final product."
Q2,272.838363,342.151801,"Interviewer: Well put, well put. I like how you uh, brought in the logisitics and the project completion. That's awesome. And when you read a real job posting - a real one - you'll want to, um, relate what is in the job posting to your experience. In other words, they want to hire who is in their job posting. They really don't want your work life history.They want to know what you do that's in that job posting. So, just, just remember that when you're doing that, because the person knows who they're hiring. Um, but they're also trying to find out that your experience fits that. So, I'm going to read from your resume and say, tell me a little bit about, so here at Haskell we're hiring you as a project manager, so as that project manager you're going to be supporting, um, not only the client, but our project leads, so tell me how your effectively manage or direct your schedule, uh, and the travel and the training, and everything that their team needed, so I see that you've did that and I'd like to know more about how that can relate to us."
A2,342.840725,507.034346,"Veteran: Well, as we, um, sort of hit on just a second ago, we realize there is a big team when we're completing this type of projects, um, and making sure that every's on the same schedule can obviosuly be challenging. Particularly, if they're in different timezones, or even international timezones, so, um, coordinating those types of things, um, coordinating everyone's calandar, um, and managing best times for all the leads involved. Um, I think one of the biggest, um, components of that is communicating, um, and being, being able to be approachable in commiunication, you know, so, um, watching any snarkiness, or frustration, or um, you know, everyone's going a million miles an hour, so being patient will all parties involved, um, and just keeping everyone's calandar, you know, there's so many, um, apps, so that Calandry, um, oh, GoToMeeting, anything, I mean, even Google Maps now, oh, forgive me, Google Calandar, um, and of course Outlook has all these options, says ""Hey here's seven times I'm available, which may, are, all the rest of you ready?"", Vote, there are so many options, so managing calandars in certainly one way, um to keep everybody on the same page, um and then, of course, well as I sort of discussed too you know, um, doing that in a way that is um, is, uh, it doesn't doesn't offend anyone's you know, um, work performance, or, or, or work position neccessarily, and, um, I mean that's how I would handle coordinating calandars and that sort of thing. and travel, of course. Ha ha, that's a, you know, fortunately, you know, post-COVID, we're all Zooming, you know, we're all, I mean, we're Zooming on the way to drop off kids, you know, we're, we're multi-tasking in ways that are sort of unprecedented, so um, um, travel coordinating that, obviously previously, way ahead of time letting everyone know that um, clear itineraries and um, options for travel, uh, flights, etcetera, car rentals, ha ha ha, so, uh, I think in terms of coordinating a project like that making sure everyone's on the same page is some of the definite things I would keep in mind."
Q3,508.106006,593.073335,"Interviewer: Excellent, well , one of the things that I liked about that answer is that you provided the context, action, and result of how you would use a technical solution. I also like part of that answer is that you respect that everyone's time is important; everyone from the director to the person who shovels gravel. Um, sometimes becasue that person shoveling gravel is sometimes making us more money ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Um, so I really like how you did that and how you wrapped that question back into itself. So, we talked about why you would want to work from hou- for Haskell. We talked about how your experience relates to the job and the job description and then I, as I promised our third part would be a little bit about teamwork so, I see that um, that you have international experience and here at Haskell, we have offices in the APEC region, have the Phillipines, Manell, we also have Mexico City, and then we are in every time zone in the United States. So, thinking about cultural differences, especially between our latin american, uh, communities, um we have offices in Columbia and Mexico City, and then doing a join project out from the Phillippines and Maylasia, how would you prepare for a meeting where you have to bring these teams together and what are your leadership approaches?"
A3,593.991901,738.359812,"Veteran: Um, I think, speaking from experience, um, having spent quite a n, quite a bit of time in latin america, um, what's important to keep in mind is, um, the United States, typically, culturally influ-, uh, focuses, emphasizes, um, being on time, being ahead of schedule. We're often quick to begin a meeting, we, we, we start ""Hey everyone"", and get straight to business, well um, what's quite common in latin america, uh, is um, meetings very rarely start right at time, and then when they do start, it's usually a, a solid ten to fifteen minutes of very casual ""Hey did you try that new resurant?"", ""Oh, my family owns it"", or ""Try this new coffee we're trying here in the office"". It's very informal, um, and finally, something that I've noticed about latin america um, is, um, a um, their work schedule even being on time and starting meetings, but we are as americans are quite like ""Hey tomorrow I'll work it out, I'll get it done"". Whereas, in latin america, there's a very sense of manana, which means tomorrow, I'll do it tomorrow, ha ha ha, yeah, so, tomorrow, manana, and so, you have to understand that you are going to have to pull the reins a little bit to recognize that productivity is going to be a little bit slower and you can't impose newer cultural values on an entire, you have to adjust, you have to adapt, and be flexible. Um, and, then finally the last thing typically you know, um, with coastal areas, um, warm weather does tend to make culture very relaxed and so, that plays back into a lot of these other um, um, aspects that we have to consider. So, um, those are the kind of things that I would have to consider and keep in mind and try to express to my team and make sure that everyone's you know cohesive and, and aware of the subtle differences "
IRR,738.972189,746.358989,"Interviewer: That's very perceptive, it's, and, and, uh, twelve years in europe. The differences in northern Europe and southern Europe"
IRR,746.703451,749.216288,"Veteran: Ha, yeah, yeah."
IRR,749.311613,795.653344,"Interviewer: And, and one of the things that I've recently learned here at Haskell is I, I've never worked in the pacific, and I have learned that you know, um, over the years, just through my husband working out of China and Thailand, and um, other, other places in Asia is, and now with our Asian team is I've now learned that always send an agenda two days prior give them time to review. They like to feel prepared, also with english as not their first language, they like the time to research that and have their answers together. They also like to say yes, even though when the answer is truly no, and giving them the latitude to say no in a safe space has been a real challenge for me ha ha ha."
IRR,795.735052,814.218031,"Veteran: Right, no yeah, and, and, and, more importantly, or more equally as important is understanding that you cannot ignore these concepts. You're, if you try, you will wind up, wildly unsuccessful and your project is project is going to really stutter "
IRR,815.634153,819.934069,"Interviewer: When can you start? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."
IRR,820.070248,824.169159,"Veteran: Ha ha ha ha. But seriously, are you hiring? Ha ha ha"
IRR,824.169159,840.818163,"Interviewer: So, at at the end, so typically, and you know, like I said, we didn't give you the time to preapare and research. Um, but what would be a question you would ask for your emplyer that kind of tells you that these, this is the right place for Jacqueline?"
IRR,842.081191,958.892131,"Veteran: Well, excuse me. Um, I did have some, but it seems some alergies are going around, but I've initally I used to say what is the most challenging aspect of the job and I think I'll hang on to that question, but moving forward, post-pandemic, I really do find myself shifting some of my own personal values and, and I would want ot know how our team and management incorperates, or feels about about the concept of work-life balance, and um, flexibility as well as, um and I suppose you know, um, similar to that is sort of in terms of paid time off, is it only sick days? What sort of leave? And, and, and that sort of range is closer to um, work-life balance, so I think a couple of questions, and I think um, um, and again, I haven't done research obviously, this is leading towards my own personal values, but how um, inclusive and diverse your your organization is and um, and finally, what um, what, um, type of community inclusion do you have? I mean is it sort of corperate responsibility and what are you doing to to feed back to the community that you are providing for how, how do you, um, create connections between the people that you work with in the community? And I think that I'm going in circles, but those are some of the questions that I had ha ha ha."
IRR,958.892131,1078.382221,"Interviewer: No, those are perfect and a way to get it, get around the asking the, asking the uh, leave question, the personal time off quesiton, without seeming like that's what you're after, you can say do you have na employee handbook I can review? I'd like to read, review your policies. Any company worth its salt will give you their employee handbook. And, during the process. Also, I love your DEI question. And I think that that's important and I can tell you here at Haskell our president, Jimmel Leary has signed the CEO pledge. So, the CEO pledge is corporations all across America who have agreed to serve princples to ensure diversity and inclusion and value, and, and, and also what we call psyhcological safety in the workplace is valued as far as team members. We at Haskel have six pillars that is our twenty-twenty-five, so as a recruiting tool we would send this to you. These are our goals for our team members and our company between now and twenty-twenty-five and our, one of our ones is making it the best job of our lives and our's to expand diversity and then we also talk about our corporate social responsibility and what we're doing as a company to make sure that we are making sure that these values translate to your team member. You don't have a company that's doing that for you Jaquiline, it doesn't sound like they're who you want to be with. But there's, I love asking the DEI question tell me what your doing to make sure that your team members have diversity and are included. Not only diversity of people, but of diversity of thought and opinion, so basically that, that diveristy of thought if we all approach a program the same way, we only come up with one solution. So, I also love your corperate social responsibility question. Those are excellent questions at the end of an interview. "
IRR,1079.341545,1079.913164,"Veteran: TikTok"
IRR,1079.913164,1083.100086,"Interviewer: Ha ha ha ha."
IRR,1083.14094,1090.017982,"Veteran: Tik tok, ha ha ha ha ha. You can learn a lot. I mean it's a terrible app in a lot of ways, but in many ways it's very informative though. Ha ha ha. Ah, I'll tell you what. "
IRR,1090.05566,1098.719824,"Interviewer: There you go, where was this when I was teaching management training? And, and, and where is TikTok for AKO? That's all I got. Ha ha ha ha ha."
IRR,1098.828767,1106.332233,"Veteran: Oh my goodness. You know, I haven't dealt with AKOs since twenty-twelve when I got out and I'm not sad about that at all. Ha ha ha ha."
IRR,1106.551569,1148.116668,"Interviewer: It's okay someone mentioned ASAT data to me the other day and I thought my eyes rolled in the back of my head and, I'm never doing ASAT data again. Ha ha ha ha. So there's- Doesn't it? There's things you're going to miss. There's things you're going to, um, never miss again. You're going to find comrades in arms everywhere, um, but you the Army is your former life. You have just gotten an education at a world class university you definitely want to emphasize what you've done in that interrum, and then you definitely want to inteview that company becuase you want it to be your best fit. "
IRR,1148.422856,1151.905751,"Veteran: For sure, they are giving me that, hey they're giving me that."
IRR,1152.250214,1158.450532,"Interviewer: Oh, okay, no, no, no, I'm with you. Okay, so we are at our end and,and we're good to go. "
IRR,1158.718447,1164.650851,"Veteran: Alright, thank you so much Barbara, I really appreciate all your feedback and your valuable, um, comments"
IRR,1164.918766,1166.908991,"Interviewer: I wish you the best. You're going to do great."
