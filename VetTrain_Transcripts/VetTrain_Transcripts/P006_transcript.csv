IRR,0,1.34955,"Interviewer: Hey <NAME>, how ya doing?"
IRR,1.34955,3.327305,"Veteran: I'm doing well. How are you?"
IRR,3.327305,5.67589,"Interviewer: I am doing well, thanks for asking."
Q1,6.850182,15.145596,"Interviewer: Alright <NAME> we'll jump into this. Really quick, uh, if at any point in time you don't hear me clearly or don't understand a question, just let me know and I'll, and I'll just repeat it to you. Alright?"
BCV,15.195692,15.811887,"Veteran: Okay."
Q1,15.811887,21.806958,"Interviewer: Alright, alright, so tell me a little bit about your educational background and work experience."
A1,22.98125,92.944348,"Veteran: Educational background is, uh, Community College of the Airforce is where I got my Associate's Degree in emergency management. Um, I just finished, um, back in December. I just finished my Disaster and Emergency Management, uh, Bachelor's Degree. Um, graduated Summa Cum Laude, um, took a whole lot of time and extra effort, but I think it was worth it because I did it to show my kids. Um, and then, work background is joining the military at a seven basically, seventeen. Worked until they, until they told me it was time to go home. Um, and then worked for the Army afterwards and taught, uh, for Texas A and M down here at TEEX and ran the American Red Cross for the Brazos Valley while I worked at the airport; run ramp operations and now I work for the College of Architecture. In charge of all their buildings, all their inventory and facility management, inventory management, and asset management. That type, type work."
Q2,94.48947,104.192832,"Interviewer: Alright, alright, well thank you for that, uh, so our next set of questions I'm about to ask you, we use the star format for interviewing. Have you heard of that?"
BCV,104.563661,105.428929,"Veteran: No, uhuh."
Q2,105.428929,123.290533,"Interviewer: Alright, so basically it's a situation, task, action, and results, right? So, uh, this, si simplify it, it just, I'm going to ask you to give me examples and just tell me a story. But, just make sure it has a beg beginning, middle, and end. And, uh, teeny question, and you'll be fine."
BCV,123.661362,124.403021,"Veteran: Alright."
Q2,124.835655,134.539017,"Interviewer: Alright, alright, so describe a time when you had to deal with a major change at your work process or job duties, and how did you deal with that change?"
BCV,135.46609,138.247309,"Veteran: I didn't hear the first part of that."
Q2,138.247309,151.782572,"Interviewer: Yes sir, yes sir. So, describe a time when you had to deal with a major change in your work process or job duties? And then, how did you deal with that change?"
A2,152.524231,257.036244,"Veteran: I can do that fairly recently, when I was working for the airport. Um, COVID happend as everybody in deployment knows and the company I was working for, um, went from twenty-three employees to seven at the snap of a finger. HR came in and said that they had to lay off s, uh, sixteen people. And, unfortunately, in doing so, our workload did not change. So, we did what, uh, what we knew how to do which was grin back and you keep pushing through until the job gets done because that's what you do. When the mission, when there's a mission, you just keep pushing through until the mission happens, um, and then you just have to explain to the customers that you got to understand that um, we're fairly understaffed and we are moving as quickly as possible.Um, so we all ended up working rather late work schedules is what we'll call it. Um, and taking on a lot of additional duties we did that for about five months and then we started hiring people back on. And then, I was the company trainer, so I had the responsibility of training all of those folks, um, as they were coming on, so we had to step away from working out on the ramp neccessarily. And training people to do that, so thats, that was a an example of one time that we had a rapid change and how we dealt with it."
Q3,259.137609,260.373706,"Interviewer: Alright."
Q3,262.042437,281.387358,"Interviewer: Alright, so this is a two part question. So what is the toughest work or, work or school group that you had to get cooperation from and then how did you go about establishing rapport with that group? And what, uh, actions did you take to get confidence, to gain their confidence?"
A3,283.612333,380.707763,"Veteran: Uh, I would say from the city and state govenment of New York. Um, one of the things that I've did when I was employed by Texas A and M engineering extension service was,  I was an exercised designer. One of the exercises that I designed involved, um, a train incident, uh, going into uh, pen station. And, it caused major disruptions, which been working for UP, I'm sure you can understand, uh, the, the totality of messing with pen station and all, but essentially we shut down seven lines, in or out of Pen Station with this, with this scenario we created, um, and I had to convince, uh, the mayor, uh, the mayor, the mayor's office, and the governor's office of New York why is was important that they, number one let us develop this exercise, and then, send their people down to College Station, we go through that exercise. So, um, that wa, that was the toughest group I ever dealt with was, uh, trying to get all those people into one office and actually paying attention because I'm sure you can image the, uh, I, I wasn't high on the radar at the time until they realized how much they were paying for the exercise "
Q4,380.707763,381.449421,"Interviewer: Yep."
Q4,382.994543,384.23064,"Interviewer: Um, okay."
Q4,386.51742,398.507562,"Interviewer: Alright, so tell me about a time when you or your team were not meeting an established goal or deadline. What, what steps did you take to ensure that goal or deadline was met?"
A4,400.114488,402.957512,"Veteran: Hm, let's see."
A4,409.508827,599.064323,"Veteran: I guess I can go with one that I'm going through right now, we have an annual inventory, and, so a couple of things are happening. Number one, the inventory process that was done the last two years, uh, essantially becuase of the whole COVID mess, there were some major allowances made, um, and, I am having to work with a new data management system that the guy before me, did not have to, uh, he retired in February. He did not have to do propery inventory before he left, so he never had to learn how to use this new system, so all the notes and everything, uh, they're having to go into this new system that's never been done I haven't been there long enough to know anybody yet, so that's making the process a bit more laborious than it probably should be. Um, and, what am I doing, is um, I'm using a lot of electronic communication, but I'm also using, uh, the data management process that, that I've come up with and, and asking people to send me pictures of their, there at Texas A and M, they use an asset tag on anything. And, so I'm having people send me a picture bec, of that asset tag, becuase it, loo being in the Summer, I have faculties scattered to the four corners of the world right now most of whom take their equipment with them. I've got several in South Carolina, I've got a couple in South Korea. Um, and so, I'm using all those pictures as the, the CYA process if you will, when property management offices show me that you actually saw this piece of equipment. They say, ""hold that thought, I've got a picture that says this person who's responsible for this piece of equipment sent me this picture, this date, and this time"", so since they're in South Korea that's what I have to do, uh, and then I'm scheduling, I've got seven different buildings that I'm responsible for to put equipment in all of those. So, what I've done is every week I send out an email to the building proctor and tell him or her that ""hey, this week I'm coming to your building, so if you could, let all your folks know that I'll be there that week don't be alarmed. It's not a big deal, I'm just going to scan whatever tags I can"". And then, I'm sticking to those, I'm sticking to those parameters of making sure that I go into that building that week and holding onto all those pictures becuase I know that next year is going to be exponentially just as difficult because now all of a sudden everyone will be back, so that's a current, that's a current issue that I'm dealing with."
Q5,599.744177,600.67125,"Interviewer: Okay."
Q5,602.278176,610.498222,"Interviewer: So, uh, how do you react in a situation where you need to make an immediate decision on a major issue."
A5,611.601545,614.340109,"Veteran: You make the decision and move forward.  "
BCI,614.453733,615.074846,"Interviewer: Alright."
A5,615.175037,682.686295,"Veteran: And, that's what I do because it's, it's a lot easier, one of the things we did in the military was you, you just fire and overcome. And, a lot of times if you're well trained enough, well versed enough, and this is what I tell people, or used to tell people when I was in the emergency management world, yes, those exercises that we go through, oh my gosh I understand the, they are hard to get through some times. They won't make you want to pull your hair out, but what they do is they help you develop those, uh, decision making, and decision, those management types skills not necessarily for the exact situaiton that you're going to go through, but those skills themselves will help you be more fluid and fluent when it comes to making decisions on the fly. You're not going to question yourself, so much that you need to understand that you need to keep moving forward. Evaluate, adjust, keep moving forward until the situation is resolved."
Q6,684.664051,690.906341,"Interviewer: Alright, thank you for that. So how would you define leadership?"
A6,692.822292,763.032609,"Veteran: Um, one of my favorite sayings is about leadership and management. Management people follow you because they have to. Leadership people follow you because they want to. And so, I, that's what I've always, that's what I've operated under is it, leadership is the art of being able to influence people and they want to work for you, they want to work with you. Or, it, it's important to understand too that good leadership also equates to good followership because you don't necessarily always have to be in charge of a hundred percent of every operation. There are going to be others on your team that are going to step up, and that they may actually be better in certain scenario than you. And it's important as a leader to understand that and to empower them and then to be a good follower becuase leadership equals teaching as well, so you have to be able to teach that to be a good leader, means to be a good follower."
Q7,768.595047,777.309531,"Interviewer: Alright, alright, so, can you, what, what would, what is the most impactful leadership role that you've actually held?"
BCV,777.80397,779.349092,"Veteran: The most what?"
Q7,779.349092,781.574067,"Interviewer: Impactful leadership role that you've had."
BCV,782.624749,783.82419,"Veteran: That I've had?"
Q7,783.860846,784.664309,"Interviewer: Uhuh."
BCV,784.973334,789.855917,"Veteran: That I was the leader, or happened to me?"
Q7,789.855917,791.710063,"Interviewer: No, that you were the leader."
A7,793.502404,828.236734,"Veteran: Um, I was in charge of American Red Cross disaster response operations for the El Paso shooting, um, I don't know that I can really go more poinient than that becuase I had sixty-eight people at one point that had flown in from all over the country that all worked for me. What's, what's that? You broke up there."
Q8,829.225611,833.675561,"Interviewer: Yeah, so what's the greatest challenge you faced in that role?"
A8,833.675561,886.827738,"Veteran: Uh, I think it was working with so many different agencies becuase in that a, in that response operation alone, you had probably forty-five different agencies that were all involved with helping all those people, uh, in some capacity. So, representing the largest non-profit in the country was as it relates to disaster relief operations to people like the FBI, uh, all these other different alphabet soup agencies that if you will being that, being that talking head for a, an organization the size of the red crossI think that was probably the most difficult was trying to get everybody on the same sheet of music."
Q9,889.917981,895.604028,"Interviewer: Alright, last question I have for you is, why should we uh, make you an offer today?"
A9,897.458174,952.217277,"Veteran: Uh, I've gotten that question every interview and I'm never sure that I get the answer right,uh, because it's, it's hard to, it's hard to feel like you're bragging about yourself, it's hard to feel like one of the hardest things for me to do is to is to talk about myself, so this is a really hard question, but, um, one thing that I've always told people is that I'm incredibly loyal, incredibly hard working, and I don't ha, I don't have a I never s, I never, I, I have a never say never attitude as a can do attitude. We can get through anything, we just have to work together to do it, um, every, every problem has a has a solution and only the lazy ones sit around for somebody else to do it, and that's not what you'll get with me."
IRR,953.824203,958.274153,"Interviewer: Alright, thank you. So, what questions do you have for me?"
IRR,959.51025,981.636389,"Veteran: Um, normally, I would have a list of them, but they wouldn't let us bring those, those in here. Um, so, what, what would be your expectations of me in this role in the first thrity, sixty, and ninety days?"
IRR,982.877381,1011.966276,"Interviewer: Well, in the first thirty days, probably even, probably even the first ninety days I guess, the first thing I guess sort of like the fire hydrant, drinking from a fire hydrant, not a fire hose, you know, um, it's it's just to be, um, just take as much of that in, as much of that in, as much as you can in, right? Because it's a, with our industry people know about us, they don't know about us. That make sense? "
IRR,1012.14996,1012.458884,"Veteran: Uhuh."
IRR,1012.667616,1258.707564,"Interviewer: Alright, so a lot, lot of stuff that you're learning is, is you're, you're learning everything from history now, just think of basic training, you know, that, that, that's probably the best way to do it right, you, you, you knew about the service you didn't know about it until you got there, right? And then you just started drinking from this big fire hydrant, so uh, a lot of that. The first first thirty days, uh, is, is realistically, uh, uh, you staying afloat went through that, so our expec expectations as a whole always telling people ""show up"", right? Are you that person would it be thirty days, first day, twenty years, show up, right? And that's that, I'm sure you've seen it in you're positions you've had and probably in the current position you have now, or probably in your lifetime. There's a difference between being on time and showing up, right? There, there's, there's a big difference, right? I get, I could get, majority of the people I could get on time. I just sometimes we need to get people to show up, right? So you're not, are you mentally engaged, right? Uh, do you have that inquizitiveness about yourself, or inquizitiveness about what you're doing, right? That keeps fueling the fire to show up the next day and you're going to show up number one to do your job, but to also part of that is you know, do you have that drive and ambition to continue the next day to continue to grow right? Uh, the most successful we have here are the ones that show up not just on time, but just show up, and you know, and actually do what they're supposed to be doing, right? Uh, and, and, and, uh, to make that part more successful is the ones who actually are more inquizitive about not only their job, but all those jobs that are there's, you know, uh, that's attached to their jobs, right? Because you're just, and you do it, right? There's you're not the only person on the island, right, out there. Right, so, what other departments affect you, right? And you inquizitive know, to know what your decisions at this point in your department affect this person over here, or that person over here, or effect that person in the field, right? I think we don't have at with we have a lot of that, we just need more of that, right? Knowing that if I make a decision today, um, uh, I, my, what where my impact, where my impact is, well mine is, is the, if I hire somebody today, and turn out to be not a great cadidate, or employee, how does that impact? That ripples, right? It's a ripple, like a rock, a big rock in a small pond, it ripples. So, the same thing with decision making, right? Uh, everytime I make a decision, it, it's not naturally right there in front of me, it's everything else around me, what, how does that impact. So, those people that can quickly, uh, make decisions handle conflict, um, can, can, you know, take that take that data in quickly and, and come out with a product, alright? Now that doesn't mean that the product is always good, right? I mean, just go on, okay? Go on Amazon, right? You can see a product is not always good, right? But, I'm, I'm coming in with the data and coming out with the product, right? And standing by your decision and on that product, whatever that decision is. Um, but then, um, just being a, an overall a, a supportive, like our roles that you would interview for us, would be in those management type roles, right? So, we're looking for people, strong leaders that have great strong leadership traits, right? That's willing to sit there an not only grow for themselves, but grow for those that they're leading and supporting, so those are our successful thirty, sixty, ninety, all combined together for a long lesser. People do that, stay here twenty years, sit at VP levels by the time they retire, so  "
IRR,1259.016588,1260.932539,"Veteran: Right, okay."
IRR,1261.365173,1263.346434,"Interviewer: Long answer, but hopefully I got it."
IRR,1263.466538,1283.553116,"Veteran: No, it's, it's, it's a good answer. It answered my next question, which would have been, what are the successful traits, so they kind of lend themselves um, into each other plus, my thrid question is what are the expectations of me? And that's kind of where you started, so."
IRR,1284.047555,1430.882169,"Interviewer: Yeah, showing up, I mean, I mean, you need, if, if we had more people show up, uh, I mean and this is not just us as an organization, but it's across the world, if we just show up, I'm going to be honest with you, you know, we'd be in a better place. I think, uh, you know, people just don't show up. They'll have their head, head on straight when they show up, right? Coming in, right? And, you know, you're, you're at a job I'm paying you to do a certain job, right? I want you to be really good at it, I want to give you all the tools you need to be successful and some, and, and it's just human nature sometimes, right? We just don't show up sometimes. And which is fine, it's just when, uh, you're not showing up a majority of the time it's, it's where the issue is, alright? Um, um, I always, I don't believe in, I don't believe in the old Orwell statement of, you know, I'll give you a hundred. I don't believe that, I don't believe a hundred ten is possible to give me a hundred ten. I don't believe that. I don't truly believe that, right? I, I don't, you can give me a hundred percent, and you can only give me that, eighty percent of the time, right? So, so, right? And you know, there's the old joke is, you know, uh, you know, ninety percent of the statistics is a hundred percent made up, right? Uh, so, you know, it's kinda w, where, what number you want to put to it, but realisitically it's that simple. I always tell people that the people are successful here, uh, and I use this analogy with everyone, whether you've been on the military or not, but I always say if I'm willing to be in a fox hole with you, then that means that person that you're going to work for is going to be able to work with you in that fox hole. And when you're in that fox hole, you know, as a fox hole, that's a defensive measure right? you got all the enemy around you, right? You can take that and place, replace the enemy as a fire, whatever that fire is at that time where ever the emergency is happening, replace the enemy with emergencies, or place uh, foxhole, or cubicle or whatever in a, in a truck out in middle, on the mainline I don't know where, right? Okay, what am I, can I count on you, right? Can I count on you when a, when a you know, you know, the you know what hits the fan? Can I count on you to be there to show up and do what you, you're tasked to do. That, that's what we look for. That's where our successful folks that come in and that come in and do really well here, right? They, they see the mission, they focus on the mission, right? Work is work, home is home, and they they are successful, they keep them separet and they, they focus on what needs to be handled, so. Long answer, I know we went over a little bit, but hey. Good job though nathan, thank you."
