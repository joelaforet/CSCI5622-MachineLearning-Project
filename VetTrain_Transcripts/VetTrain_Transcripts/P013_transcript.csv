IRR,2.018374,3.817232,"Veteran: It's going well, it's going well <NAME>, How are you?"
IRR,4.0086,17.540025,"Interviewer: Good, good, well looking at your CV, unlike every kid in my family and my husband want to be you. We're like, okay. Are you a roper, and header, a healer, a just do veteranary ha ha ha ha ha. "
IRR,17.604392,20.050341,"Veteran: 'm a horse adjacent now, so,"
IRR,20.121774,20.854929,"Interviewer: Gotcha."
IRR,20.887113,27.853035,"Veteran:  I, I, I had horses as a kid and they've all moved on now, so horse adjacent now, but."
IRR,27.853035,37.612796,"Interviewer: Gotcha, gotcha, well our family will never be that way this is a family of ropers and you know, hoh. It's that rodeo, ha ha ha ha ha."
IRR,37.612796,40.100578,"Veteran: Yeah, it's a fun time. I do like that part of it."
Q1,40.483314,149.486445,"Interviewer: There you go, there you go, but what we're here for today is um, for an interview practice and um, basically I've been volunteering with this group. i'm a veteran myself. When I finished the military, I started writing lessons for um, any, any of the defense knowlede online, um, gorups. Um, civil engineers, Marine Corps, Navy, um, then worked ten years in the railroad with my former colonel and this colonel compadre, so working with three marine colonels for ten years was a lot of fun for ten years ha ha ha. But the interview process that I typically prescribe to most HR organizations that you'll typically encouter that you'll dercibe to are three part. We ask what attracts you to the company, what makes you think the company is a great fit for you? Then we ask how you think your education and experience relate to the job. The employer is looking to find out not your whole work life history. They want to know if you have the skills that they need for that job and then they'll need to know a little bit more about your leadership and team work. Sometimes there's those fluffy behavioral questions. I don't do that, I just ask. Um, and then they give you time to ask questions about the company to make sure it's the best fit for you and then they give you that moment, that  moment for that elevator pitch. So that, that's the process that I like to take when we do this. Sometimes I'll interject uh, with some old chief coaching moments um, becuase that's just what I like to do, but I reliase that you might have not had time to prepare or research what Haskell is, or memorize the job description, or practice any of this. So, we're going to wing it. So, I'm going to ask you the questions as if we were completely in it. Is that fair?"
BCV,149.486445,151.247029,"Veteran: That's totally fair, yeah."
Q1,151.247029,162.690827,"Interviewer: Okay, okay, so with that <NAME>, so <NAME> is a design-build construction firm, can you please tell me what makes you think Haskell is the right place for you?"
A1,167.054014,212,"Veteran: When I was in the Army, I was Poligifair's officer and one of the things I did was design strategic communications for our customer, who was the Iraqi government. Particularly, the Iraqi ministry of communications, of bureau of communication, so, um, taking their input and utilizing my skills to create a product that was uh, mutually benefiical for the Iraqi government, particularly, the bureau of, of um, the ministry of communication but also that um, promoted the American, um, interests in the region well, so mutually, um, uh, beneficail product."
Q2,214,245,Interviewer:  That makes complete sense and having an entire federal division here at Haskell who works here on a lot of military based projects and we employ project managers to make sure that those projects stay online they also stay within governing accounting principles and that we also don't viloate any federal or military regulations while we're in there. Can you tell me how your experience and your skills would align to being one of our project managers for a federal government contract?
A2,246.930958,283.635313,"Veteran: Right, and, uh, that's a really great question so, uh, as the platoon lead fourty-two soliders in an enviornment and as commander, I had about two-hundred soliders under my perview so, managing their, uh, training, and medical, and personel readiness, I was part of my job, so when it came to training and, and mission success, uh, we had to abide by the financial constraints we had, but also to the good stewards of tax-payer's money, so, doing what we needed to have done, but not exceeding the bill per se."
Q3,284.439058,331.017994,"Interviewer: Oh, that's excellent, now Haskell is an employee staff owned program so, it's also fiscally responsible to the company, but we also practice servant leadership and that we make sure that our client's best interest are taken care of. Eighty percent of our business is threepeat buisness, meaning that our customers come back to us becuase they truist us. And in the cleint relationship model, you can consider us a trusted advisor, and that's something that the Haskell compnay prides itself on. Now um, we do work a lot of teams. I did mention our clients, so I would like to find out a little bit about your leadership strategy and how you approach working in teams, especially in teams that might be in conflict for resources."
A3,331.821739,389.385191,"Veteran: Sure so, uh, again, I was afforded some great opportunities to uh, develop and showcase my leadership in the Army and taking care of soliders was kind of my number one responsibility and there were instances where a conflict did arise with sister platoons, or senior leadership, um, but appraching it in such as way that and coming to that mutual system, that mutally beneficial result, um, so, having my own interests in mind, having the interests of my platoon, or the platoons to our left and right, ultiamately looking at the big picture and relizing that our interests, or conflict may be, uh, is present. We're still working for the same organization, right? Our organization's goals are important right? Minimizing our contact to to achieve that overall mission success was very important."
IRR,389.959294,404.311884,"Interviewer: Excellent, excellent, now speaking of your interests, what questions, do you have for me about the Haskell company, the Haskell philosophy, or the way that we do business to know that we're the right fit for you?"
IRR,404.924261,456.708403,"Veteran: Right, that's a great question, so I wanted to know, um, what is the Haskell company doing to promote the development of junior leaders as they move through their, their, um, I don't want to say the life cycle of the company, but their, throuhg their career, so in the Army, there are certain, um educational, um thresholds that have to be met. Are there simialr thesholds at Haskell and are there, um, are their employees given a, uh, finanncial means to acheive those thresholds if threre are of time, are they given time to pursue that extra training to make it, make it past project manager to district manager and things like that?"
IRR,457.282506,608.577934,"Interviewer: Those are all very fair questions and um, when the training department is comprised of Brooke Jones, who is a West Point grad, myself who is a Navy Cheif, and then we have that submarine guy over in techical training, um, who used to be the cheif of the boat, um, you have a very familiar training structure with which to join, so we believe that, so we have a, a, a, just basically a career path that we talk about, um, this is Haskell has it's pillars of success as a company and one of those is making this the best job of your life believe it or not, that sounds like a very lofty goal. Everything we do is beneath that pillar. And the way that we approach that is that we have technical training which you abolutely need and require like certifications and your basic how-to's, and then that is all taken care of within our training program, we also do have external  acollegent relationships for that. We also have tuition assistance if that's something you want to do out on top of it, we also have the requried training that the government makes you do like ethics, cybersecurity all those things and we also believe in personal and professional development, so we use DISK surverys to make sure that your temperment is one way or another and you can aquire some skills that maybe you don't have, but maybe use your natural inclinations as a team member, we also have something we consider sommunication series, which we teach people how to talk to each other, we have supervisor series, which means if you get promoted you take one year to complete a cohort of courses that teach you how to be a supervisor within this coompany, we have leadership series. That's based on the leadership um, principles and we teach people leadership skills that way, and then we have soemthing called epic which is intentional coaching, so you are basically with a small group of cohorts and then you work through corporate problems and that you have a mentor and that you get coached throughout the thought processes and how you treat the Haskell client. So, we do look at people wholistically and we help at any company that you're going to uh, find yourself being a part of does that for its team members, we're also a member of the gallaup program, so we do use the gallup survey to make sure that our team members are engaged and we've got a ten to one ratio when it comes to engaged team memebers to not engaged team members."
IRR,608.577934,611.257084,"Veteran: That's pretty terrific, that's pretty terrific"
IRR,611.257084,639.885716,"Interviewer: So, I hope that any HR professional that you, you work with in this interview process would be able to explain their company to you in that way. If they can't they're not your people. Ha ha ha ha. What questions did you have for me since they haven't come in and given us the whole you know, gaffe about the interview processes, you know obviosuly about other employment, but you know, just as my years of experience have, what kind of questions you you have like, what works for you?"
IRR,641.990762,709.237427,"Veteran: Um, you know, my likely next step in employment is hopefully acadamia, so doing, ha ha ha ha, so going was hopefully taking the board certification, residency, and getting into a academic position, but um, I feel like um, you know. it's been so weird with Zoom the past year and as a, you know, I just wonder how that in your, you know, are you getting the same, uh, quality people, like is it different before you know, like, in interview, you know, I just feel like there's there's differences in this and how people behave somewhat, I'm assuming this is what this is all for the, to evaluate that, or maybe not, but I don't know, I'm a fan of old face-to-face, um, traditional type things. I don't know if there's any differences you experienced, or "
IRR,709.390521,807.256044,"Interviewer: I can tell you that, and, and I started here six months ago, so I started after CSX started to downsize the department, um, and so eighy-five of us, um, we know what was happening, the department, which was being absorbed, so we rode it out, so that was a choice, so um, I didn't work in the middle of COVID, I had worked remotely and helped bring the remote strategy to the team before I left. Um, made sure they were all successful. But I can tell you that the interviewing remotely was completely different for me joining Haskell, but what I thought was interesting was when I got here, everyone is exactly who I thought they would be. There wasn't a lot of oh, you're very different online, like, some people were taller and shorter, that was completely different, but their two personalities cam through. There were a couple, um, Zoom interviews that I did that you actually went to an in person interview afterwards with masks on some of them, some of them I left like running, like the unprofessionalism of people in the interview translated into the unprofessionalism as a company in general. Um, so I dodged some bullets there getting to be able to see the building, how they expect people to park, just the general conditions they expected to work in. I was going to say, are there hobos in the parking lot and do you run? Ha ha ha ha ha. "
IRR,807.677053,809.820373,"Veteran: Are you in Jacksonville Florida?"
IRR,809.820373,810.777212,"Interviewer: I am."
IRR,810.777212,812.308155,"Veteran: Okay, I'm from Jacksonville"
IRR,812.308155,813.686004,"Interviewer: Oh, so you can see the river?"
IRR,813.686004,816.365154,"Veteran: I'm looking like, that looks like familiar."
IRR,816.365154,821.264171,"Interviewer: Yeah, CSX is that way, the Acosta bridge is that way, and the bucket is that way."
IRR,821.264171,835.808128,"Veteran: Yeah, I'm from North Park and I went to UNF for, for a year and uh, and lived on Jack's beach, and I was, I think I recognize this stuff over there, so. That's too funny, what a small world. Ha ha ha."
IRR,835.808128,848.055671,"Interviewer: It is, it is, and what I thought was pretty funny is that my boss, she's a West Point graduate, she was born in the same small town in Oklahoma as my husband. I'm like who comes from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma?"
IRR,848.055671,857.509243,"Veteran: Yeah, I know where Broken Arrow is, that's funny that you say that. What is happening, what research project did I sign up for? But, that's really funny. That's really funny."
IRR,857.738884,927.664699,"Interviewer: I do hope that, when you get to um, you know, your classroom to, to, to your chair of whatever department of whatever you're going to be in academia, I can tell you that my best partners in recruiting, I still have most of their cards I can look right over, were professors. When I was looking at my intern programs, I was looking at my management trinees, when I was looking to hire, finding a partner in industry whatever you're teaching is important, um, a lot of times I've had peoples like I don't understand why you hired me, becuase a Donna Dunn out of USF called and said hire this kid, you're going to love him, or you know, Brian Gibson out of Auburn said hey, this kid's kind of awkward, but you're really going to like how he thinks, that those colleged partnerships were probably my best recruiting tool, you don't want people that do call them um, those commercial dot classroom, you don't want those people.  You want partnerships. Now what made you choose Texas, what that just where you wound up?"
IRR,927.970888,960.46515,"Veteran: That's where I'm asked, so it's all kind of either residency, or, for um, you know, all programs, you put your stuff in this big algorithm and the school matches you and then you go there, and that's where you end up, so. I matched with Tennesee for my first year, and then I wanted to come here. And yeah, it was good I like Knoxville a lot. And then, I matched here and I really enjoyed it, so in another year, and then potentially two, and then we'll see where the next step is "
IRR,960.809612,966.856836,"Interviewer: That's one of my best candidates out of uh, Univeristy of Tennesee Knoxvillem, I love that campus "
IRR,966.856836,975.981714,"Veteran: I do too, I'm a big fan. Like, it was a little cold. It was a little cold, but it's um. Big fan of Knoxville, I liked it and I really valued my time there, so, it was a great experience."
IRR,976.12654,977.075955,"Interviewer: Excellent"
IRR,977.156413,1041.031018,"Interviewer: Excellent, excellent. Well, I'm on LinkedIn, if you come up to where you need, you need someone just to ask, you questions to, I, I had brothers and sisters that helped me through, through this after I retired. And, um, you know, I feel like I continued CSX when they got rid of our old department, um, I have been momma hen to, you know, everybody who wanted advice, or, or just wanted getting through the interview process. I'm not going to say everything that comes out of my mouth is gold, but I got, I got a pretty good track record of where I got to go. Ha ha ha. So, um, you are looking for collegette, that's good, that's good. It's, it's, you know it's tough. I, I will tell you that working with UF speaking of, you know, they did a climate survey, um and the academiacs were like cut throat on each other so bad"
IRR,1041.222386,1150.110696,"Veteran: That, that school is like an anomoly, just like their, you know, I am a gator, but the veteranary program there is a bit um, kind of, kind of snooty, and uh, so between here and Tennessee, Mississippi State, Auburn, LSU is kind of where I would like to stay in the south east. I wouldn't mind Washington and Oregon, but I'm um, um, a little cold, but I'd like to stay somewhere I'm pretty comfortable with. You know, the west coast could be an option, but, this, this job is pretty regional, so diseases and plants that you have in Texas are way more different than what they have up there so, my regional expertise isn't, not something you can't learn, but I like the, like the multipronged, multi-probed approach to, we have research, we have teaching, and we have service to the state. That carries over from the Army, I'm very proud to serve the state of Texas and the the people that live here with their animal care and stuff like that. Um, so, I wouldn't, I do three months a year in private residency and in private practice. There is, it doesn't have that, let's say it's not that bad, it's super efficent and it's super different from what we do here, but there's like not that level of altruism that I think you get from the government job maybe. I don't know if that's the right word, but I would get, I have other jobs that I get to to with research and things like that, so I just saw horses all day, that way I get burned out. So, I get to do a little research and teach students about whatever, and that kind of varied. The job is goodl like that."
IRR,1150.569979,1210.812581,"Interviewer: Oh, you know, that is excellent and you know. Speaking of that, we do have a landscape division that is, that is really well renound, but when you talk about, you know, infectious plants. I don't know if I used that word right, but that's something - invasive, invasive - I'm sorry darn things like Cudzsu, um, but like when you, and you talk about invasive plants and even like Bamboo, like, it looks great its first three years, but look out afterwards, but you know working with high end landscaping teams and designed builds, you know, like that's something that your students could possibly look at because, given an entire wing, that's all they do, is wetter than the native plants. What's the best thing for um, when you talk about chief resilliancy officers, how do you go and talk to the chief resilliancy officer about reducing your food print for water and bringing in native plants and all that "
IRR,1210.812581,1212.381797,"Veteran: Interesting, that's really cool."
IRR,1212.84108,1220.419247,"Interviewer: So, that's something that I didn't know that Haskell did, but other design-build firms do as well."
IRR,1220.419247,1240.665966,"Veteran: That's pretty cool too. I had some friends that were undergrad, landscape architecture that did those kind of things. I never did, didn't know that was a thing, so once I went to college I thought that's pretty cool. If I was taking school forever, I would take more training on just everything. Maybe find a job everntually, but. "
