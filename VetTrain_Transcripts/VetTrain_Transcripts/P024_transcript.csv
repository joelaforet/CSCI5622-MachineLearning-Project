A2,105.75175,109.02425,"Veteran: Uh, but even that uses Python code."
A2,109.5895,115.09325,"Veteran: Um, but, middle- I know like, the bare, bare minimum of Linux."

A3,147.565375,152.57825,"Veteran: I've had to pretty much start from the very beginning, and basic in- "
A3,152.9055,158.691875,"Veteran: Uh, just pretty much follow along to, uh, whatever it is that we're trying to do, so-"

A6,321.840875,324.682,"Veteran: And like, my time- time management skills."

A6,364.621375,365.454375,"Veteran: Um-"

IRR,408.22,414.25925,"Interviewer: Good. And then uh, using my last question during an interview, is uh, is there anything about the company you'd like to know?"
IRR,415.166625,420.521625,"Interviewer: Obviously, I can't answer for them. Uh, do remember that, you know, interviews work both ways."
IRR,420.834,427.155875,"Interviewer: As much as I'm interviewing you for the position, you're interviewing the company for, is this a place you wanna work at."
IRR,428.807,436.289125,"Veteran: I guess one thing I do like to ask, is say, ok- so this is like a software- a softare uh-"
IRR,436.899,437.82125,"Veteran: position, right?"
IRR,438.341875,449.42375,"Veteran: And eventually, in my career, say I don't like working in software, do I have the, the ability to, maybe move into like, something like quality engineering, or-"
IRR,450.01875,455.805125,"Veteran: Uh, or hardware, or something like, more innovative type of design?"
IRR,456.281125,458.066125,"Interviewer: That would be a great question, yes."
IRR,458.676,464.045875,"Interviewer: You know, what's the- what's the uh, horizontal and vertical movement possibility?"

IRR,484.261,488.39625,"Veteran: uh, stories, like from SpaceX, um, where they were- "
IRR,489.11025,492.71,"Veteran: like 12 hour shifts, everyday, and it's like, you know-"
IRR,493.8405,501.114375,"Veteran: Everybody's trying to get to, it's like- it's same community, but different kind of goals, and different expectations I guess."
IRR,501.4565,512.211125,"Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. As a consultant I get to see a lot of different work spaces. Um, and there's ones that are like ""hey, everyone's just having fun, we're just doing our job, we're having fun, everyone relaxes""-"
IRR,512.4045,518.02725,"Interviewer: And other places where everything has to be signed in triplicate and everything has to be CYA- um-"
IRR,518.62225,526.312625,"Interviewer: And so yeah, there's definitely a wide variety in-in workplace environments. Like, just how the people treat each other, how everything goes."
IRR,528.305875,539.5365,"Interviewer: Alright. Uh, well I think that pretty much covers it, uh, wish I had some more questions- let me think, is there any other questions I could ask you in interview style? Um..."
IRR,542.526375,546.988875,"Interviewer: Gotta pick something out of here. Well, you've covered pretty much everything that's in your resume."
IRR,548.059875,557.639375,"Interviewer: Oh, I will say one thing about your resume. If you are focused on software jobs, um, the skill section that you have would be best put at the top."
IRR,558.755,569.584,"Interviewer: Um, a lot of software jobs are very very technical, and it's really a matter of matching skills, so if you put that at the top, people will see that quicker, and think ""oh wow! I need a guy with that skill""-"
IRR,569.658375,579.07425,"Interviewer: ""Oh I need a guy with that skill"". Uh, the uh, being a consultant, I send out a lot of resumesbecause, you know, I have to hire to the client I'm working for."
IRR,579.148625,581.75175,"Interviewer: We have our skills at the top- the technical stuff that we've done."
IRR,582.421125,587.196,"Interviewer: Uh, just you know, technologies or, or software that we're familiar with."
IRR,588.0885,591.792375,"Interviewer: Uh, other than that, yeah, that looks good."
