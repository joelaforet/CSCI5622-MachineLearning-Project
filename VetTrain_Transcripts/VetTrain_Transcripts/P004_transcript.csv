Q3,220.230093,231.785918,"Interviewer: So, what, what are, ah, I've been asking people what is a strenght, a strong point for you that you would bring to this position that you're applying to?"
A3,232.810508,324.82911,"Veteran: Um, I think something that we all have in common is that our ability to adapt to various situations, um, I, I can, I, I can't, I can think of a thousand different times off the top of my head where we were tasked to do something and I didn't have the right equipment, we didn't have the right tools, or the, the tools and equipment we did have didn't work, or they broke in the middle of a job and you just, you have to improvise. Um, you know, I was in aviation, so like the mission becomes first. The mission is like, God, so like you have, you have to get those jet wheels off the ground by any means neccessary, so, it, you, have to learn, to work with what you have. You have to essentially make peanuts out of pineapples. You just got to work, to make magic happen. And just having to do that day in and day out and, the, some of the worst working conditions you can think of on the flight deck on the aircraft carrier, or on the flight line in Japan, or whatever, whereever part of the world you're in. You learn to adapt. It becomes engrained in you. And that, having to think like that, it, that's not something you just lose over overnight, you, you know, that, that though process will be with you forever.and you're going to have that with pretty much any veteran you have whether they were turning wrenches like myself or whether they were pushing paperwork in an office building. Like, it, it doesn't matter what you were doing, er, what enviornment you're in, you're going to have that trait with you for the rest of you life, likely."
Q4,324.82911,329.031228,"Interviewer: Right. That's all, yeah. So, conversely, what's something you need to improve on?"
A4,330.393026,345.958925,"Veteran: Uh, my impatience. I think um, making myself. Because, um, like, being in that mindset, um, it's not, doesn't alwasy always compute, like with other situations, you know, um. You know, like, I'm a civilian now. I don't have to think that way anymore, but it's just "
BCI,346.008304,346.211819,"Interviewer: Yeah."

A4,349.987164,350.836165,"Veteran: It doesn't go away"
BCI,350.90842,357.37528,"Interviewer: I, I understand it, like I said, the para-military, the law enforcement. I-, it doesn't. it never goes away. So, "

A5,368.458509,369.950001,"Veteran: Oh man, um"
BCI,371.649006,376.862745,"Interviewer: Including, including not dying on a aircraft carrier. Ha ha ha."
A5,376.862745,422.696958,"Veteran: Oh man, um, the like watching the jets leave the flight line. Uh, like right before my last appointment, we have to do uh, a full engine check on all five of our aircraft. And I, um, I didn't know it at the time, but that was my second to last time that I would see something like that. All five jets, all ten engines running all at once. Maybe like, twenty-five hundred RPM all at once, like, the gorund was shaking underneath you, it was just, a-, never forget something like that. It's such an awesome feeling that all that power, all that raw power. It's just knowing you have something to do with it, like you're attached to it somehow, you know? You're not the pilot in the seat, but, you know, like, we make that stuff happen and."

BCV,446.392234,446.949922,"Veteran: Yeah."
Q6,447.017154,447.667452,"Interviewer: I just want to absorb"
BCV,447.702153,447.951958,"Veteran: Yeah."
Q6,447.974538,452.102128,"Interviewer: it. You know, that was a grossly overpowered jet and so. "

Q6,452.806619,454.251727,"Interviewer: That's that's awesome. Good."
Q6,454.355507,465.042375,"Interviewer: So, are you, when you finish with your bachelors, are you wanting to stay put? Are you open to relocation? Are you wanting to stay down in your neck of the woods?"
A6,465.833515,512.471527,"Veteran: Ah, preferably, I do. I want to stay at A and M and go to graduate school here. We bought a house here. And we really like it here, um, after the chaos of being the military for the past four years, like we really just really want some normalcy, and just be. You know, I learned something the other day, um, whenever you apply to graduate school, it's typical to apply to fifteen different programs, or fifteen different schools, and I'm just applying to one becuase I don't want to go anywhere else, becuase I don't want to move. You know, I just moved here. Like, me and my wife, we drove from Washington, here to Texas during the winter and it was insane. We ran through a bunch of like a-, a-, a- I don't know if they're like blizzards or not, but, I-, I-, it was nuts. I don't want to eveer have to do that again. "

A6,514.061146,524.377838,"Veteran:   You know? Even if it's just to Austin, or Dallas, or I mean, the Navy paid for that. They did everything for us. I can't imagine doing that our, ourselves. I do not want to do that. I want to stay put here."
Q7,524.740983,535.492699,"Interviewer: Good, good. And then, last two questions here is: why would we, or why should we select you for, for this job over another candidate?"
A7,536.711832,555.323065,"Veteran: Uh, I don't know. Um, I have my unique experinces that uh, nobody else does have. And I get, we, we're not going to know until I get there and I do it. So I can't say that I'm better than anybody else. You know, I don't know if that's the, the right answer, but um, it's an honest one."
Q8,555.725119,574.683439,"Interviewer: No, that's all, hey, it's all depends on, yep. No problem. And then, do you, being that, that you had served and then you go through your, get your bachelors, and get your Masters. Do you have any concerns about going into the civilian world since that would be a first for you? Right, from an, an anything."
A8,574.829193,607.59578,"Veteran: Um, oh yeah, yeah, definitely. You know, it's it's been rough um, the my first semester, last semseter, um so I got back from my second deployment, my last deployment in Japan, , I got out back in October. Um, I started transition leave in November, got to Texas in December, and started school in January. And, it was, I didn't give myself enough time to adjust. You know?

And the issues that come with that, you know, the good, the bad, the ugly. Um, the, it's uh, it's a definite concern moving into the civilian world.
