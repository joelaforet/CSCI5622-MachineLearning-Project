A1,38.333012,39.462006,"Veteran: so like you."

A1,57.93207,65.816669,"Veteran: and then and really kind of what happened was that she was a Christian, and I wasn't. And then I ended up getting saved right after college. And so"
A1,66.365103,73.942212,"Veteran: we got married in 99, and embarked on an adventure just retired from the military in the air force after 27 years we have 3"
A1,74.389679,75.459011,"Veteran: Uh kids."
A1,75.968435,76.565057,"Veteran: Um."
BCI,77.262647,80.60144,"Interviewer: My daughter is a freshman here at A&M actually."
A1,81.266904,84.337216,"Veteran: Uh and then our 2 boys are still at home. We home school."
A1,84.88565,88.587006,"Veteran: When I say, we, you know that that really means her, although I take over"
A1,89.181334,91.551762,"Veteran: science and math starting in about the sixth grade"
Q2,92.056597,110.391273,"Interviewer: Well to do that that's great, and I tell you, with some of this crazy stuff they're teaching our kids in school. I don't blame you a bit. I mean they're they kind of crossing over the boundaries of what the school should teach our children versus what parents should be talking to their children about. So good for you and you got an Aggie on the way we tried."
Q2,110.909876,128.120148,"Interviewer: We got one. We got one nephew in. Of all the nieces and nephews. We take everyone down to a game, and we had a whole deal, and so we finally got one in. But Shawn he's a mountain kid and Eagle Scout. He launched off of Colorado State loves to play Rugby and okay. So"
Q2,128.61,132.831173,"Interviewer: what do you know about the actual position of it, the opportunity?"
Q2,133.209799,138.329281,"Interviewer: In your mind what do you know about it, and do you have any questions about it?"
A2,138.967209,143.405164,"Veteran: So, looking for the job description right? An Ops management director."
BCI,143.873283,144.414833,"Interviewer: Right"
A2,144.931141,156.911785,"Veteran: Right. How does that translate to what I'm used to in the military? There's you know it could go a number of ways. It seems that i'm somewhere between the Exec that this position is somewhere between the executive level"
A2,157.41662,166.632147,"Veteran: right and the sub executive level. And so my questions about this position would be, Where exactly does that fall? What are the responsibilities"
A2,167.334326,174.519041,"Veteran: when it comes to and in the say, when it comes to the organization, the leadership, the direction of the overall organization"
Q3,175.02617,188.938954,"Interviewer: perfect. So I think the one thing that that we're looking for in this is the ability to sort of communicate at different levels not much different for me. I mean you're looking to communicate within your team within within the plant and the facility um."
Q3,189.301517,206.784858,"Interviewer: the executives in the company in terms of metrics and efficiency improvements, and so forth, and then the customer. So you really sort of have sort of 3 tiers to communicate with. So I see in your resume the ability certainly to communicate within structure. Obviously, you've you've had to navigate a"
Q3,207.370008,220.394741,"Interviewer: a group that you've had to coordinate within a structured environment and within a lot of people. You've got some pretty big groups in terms of staff, you know 30 people and more so you know how would you say."
Q3,220.947765,234.819244,"Interviewer: How do you flex your ability to communicate within a plant environment within the people that are producing what the the product, all you know to the to the executives of the company and the clients. How do you? How do you sort of flex in those."
A3,235.519128,242.710727,"Veteran: You know. You started off our discussion today. You talked about an elevator speech. I had an opportunity to teach strategic communication for a while."
A3,243.132953,250.000998,"Veteran: and just do a lot of talent, management and leadership development, and what we've. What I've always talked to folks about is that"
A3,250.620568,252.864788,"Veteran: you have to be able to communicate with clarity"
A3,253.482063,259.592857,"Veteran: Um and consistency. You have to give your message in a way that will hold their interest and stick."
A3,260.010493,276.631026,"Veteran: whether it's now or whether it's in a month, right? And so that depends on your audience. So if i'm talking to a group of executives. That's certainly going to change the way that I communicate versus the folks at the plant right? And really, is it? What is it that they need?"
A3,277.232238,280.375981,"Veteran: But I think what it all comes back to is"
A3,280.889994,296.312693,"Veteran: being able to hold the interest of those to whom you're communicating foremost in your mind, and so everything may be helpful, but maybe not beneficial in the way that its communicated. For example, right when my son's being a chuckle head."
BCI,297.14,302.439549,"Interviewer: There's probably a way to approach that. I'm not saying I always do the right one with my son. But"
A3,302.992573,303.47446,"Veteran: Um"
A3,303.928812,310.923066,"Veteran: what does he need in order to stop becoming a chuckle head. It's not always, hey, Stop being a chuckle head. Sometimes it's hey, Why are you doing this?"
A3,311.400364,321.040411,"Veteran: Let's think through this right? Sometimes it's putting the goal out there. Sometimes it's walking through how we can get better, and sometimes it's seriously just stop being a chucklehead"
Q4,321.634739,338.523753,"Interviewer: Gotcha. And what how do you feel about making that change from? You know a structured military reporting environment to a private sector company? Is that a an exciting change for you. I mean, what do you see? What do you see the differences in that? And how how do you feel about that?"
Q4,338.987283,346.052673,"Interviewer: I could see it could be a bit liberating, maybe, to have a little more streamline communication. But i'm just putting my own self into it."
A4,346.642412,351.920228,"Veteran: Yeah, you know. at the level where you know. So I've been doing executive leadership for about 15 years."
A4,352.987265,366.38833,"Veteran: and so at that level there's quite a bit of autonomy, and there's quite a bit of freedom. Certainly. Always have someone that you're reporting to. But I've been blessed to have some fairly good bosses, some, one in particular not so good but some fairly good bosses"
A4,367.131814,368.253924,"Veteran: Um and so"
A4,368.694507,378.55714,"Veteran: the freedom that you mentioned I can see how most people transitioning from the a military environment may covet that I I really had a lot of that, and that's exacerbated a little bit"
A4,379.05509,385.087864,"Veteran: with what we all experienced in the COVID-19 dynamic right? Whereas now we're working from home, and"
A4,385.753328,386.767587,"Veteran: although"
A4,387.779551,393.23406,"Veteran: you know, we over schedule everything now in terms of the meetings we're gonna have, and right"
A4,394.179477,398.071293,"Veteran: And so for me, i'm not sure that I really feel one way or the other about it."
Q5,398.3719,413.168144,"Interviewer: I think that's a good. That's a really good. I get that because I do look at your resume and for you to be, and you also show on your resume how your position translates to the private sector. I like that a lot. I like what you did in parentheses to help me understand"
Q5,413.769356,420.917356,"Interviewer: Really, in my own words, what would that position look like? And so I I appreciate that because I think we all go into these these kinds of"
Q5,421.401538,424.389241,"Interviewer: things, thinking the military is completely, you know."
Q5,424.676079,440.208923,"Interviewer: extensively bureaucratic and structured. And so for you to be able to express that like that that that resonated with me. I I like that that easily transfers to the private sector. How about Obviously you've done all kinds of technical things. I mean"
Q5,440.47,454.539343,"Interviewer: you're a civil engineer by by training, and you have some additional postgraduate degrees and and and training, and you've had certainly a lot of technical things to manage. How about a translating that to a sort of manufacturing"
Q5,455.135966,455.840439,"Interviewer: environment?"
A5,457.068105,466.444261,"Veteran: Yeah. So you know, it's interesting, because when I look at the job description that's here, and it is very clearly manufacturing right plane operations."
A5,467.196924,483.727964,"Veteran: And although I have not worked directly in a manufacturing business at the level that it looks like that we're advertising for. I've certainly done that, because what it is is galvanizing the team to come together, assemble, Deliver a product right for a customer."
A5,484.147894,499.157546,"Veteran: and and we do that all the time. But a lot of what I've done is done that in a service atmosphere. Let's take security, For example. You come on to an insulation. We have to deliver security. We have to deliver infrastructure, utility, support."
A5,499.655497,512.969363,"Veteran: logistics, right? All those types of things. And when we're not experiencing that, then how do we walk through those processes? Break down what it is we're delivering into those processes. Focus on those to be able to improve"
A5,513.577459,513.84594,"Veteran: that"
A5,515.429285,520.904446,"Veteran: aspect of the overall delivery mechanism, if you will. uh and so"
A5,521.455174,521.980661,"Veteran: Um."
A5,522.673662,523.699394,"Veteran: it's easy to see."
A5,524.706768,536.519899,"Veteran: I don't know much about manufacturing. However, I do know quite a bit about leadership process oriented organizations, and being able to"
A5,536.946714,539.294195,"Veteran: galvanize the team to be able to improve upon."
Q6,540.157003,558.393007,"Interviewer: I I think that's good, and and I think your your resume speaks to the ability within the job description of being able to follow metrics in in terms of efficiencies and economies and and project controls for us. Project control is a big deal, and construction line is setting controls and then working within those controls. So"
Q6,558.750981,567.929793,"Interviewer: So you come into a new environment, and you see. So you see things right. You're going to see things that maybe the people that have been doing it for some time. Don't see."
Q6,568.56772,581.764556,"Interviewer: when you come to to the to the group, how do you go about? Sort of assessing? You know I have a new perspective here, but validating that, and then bringing it to leadership. What? How do you? How do you see doing that? Does that make sense?"
A6,582.134004,588.134652,"Veteran: Yeah it does because it's you know t's a valid question, because not everybody values a new perspective."
BCI,588.556877,596.879765,"Interviewer: right? Some people even feel threatened. So, interestingly enough, that was kind of what took me a back. So I told you I was a military brat."
A6,597.499334,601.70323,"Veteran: I heard my father say something to somebody they said. What was the one thing that you weren't"
A6,602.192002,606.99252,"Veteran: prepared for getting out of the military, and his comment was, I wasn't prepared for someone to lie to my face. I was like, Really."
A6,608.183471,614.030374,"Veteran: that was kind of interesting. Now I haven't had I. I have actually experienced that sadly since"
A6,615.021686,623.115103,"Veteran: retiring from military, and one of the things that I wasn't prepared for was me to threaten people people to feel threatened by me"
A6,623.622232,628.640748,"Veteran: right because of my experiences, or because of the amount of time that I've been doing."
BCI,630.552235,631.497653,"Interviewer: because"
A6,632.360461,642.64532,"Veteran: one of the things that I covet is lifelong learning. I love just learning about stuff. There's so much out there to learn, and so oftentimes i'll ask questions, and then I don't realize that."
A6,643.157038,645.7294,"Veteran: Okay, Somebody's got their gumption up because"
A6,646.238824,660.603665,"Veteran: they're taking it in a certain way, and it's not at all how I intended. So the the key is as we're communicating, to be able to recognize the dynamic as we're going back and forth with folks to be able to come alongside and help."
A6,661.214055,672.292881,"Veteran: When people ask, what is it that you want to do? What I want to do is I want to be a part of a team where we're dedicated to one another to improving one another and the overall organization to leave things and people better than we found them."
A6,673.114385,678.217804,"Veteran: And so that sometimes includes those that we're talking to. That sometimes includes the client right?"
A6,678.940636,679.553321,"Veteran: That makes sense?"
Q7,679.895232,682.492836,"Interviewer: Yes, it makes a lot of sense. It's funny. You say that because"
Q7,683.020617,702.844556,"Interviewer: Um a couple of things. One is, I tell our group that you need to listen to everybody's opinion, because sometimes the best idea comes from the most, the newest and the most unusual source. Sometimes our young engineers will be. It'd be like, Wait a minute. That person's right out of school. But, oh, my God, that's a great idea, right? And then you you hit a lot of things to leave something better than we found it, and"
Q7,703.429705,714.921577,"Interviewer: and and I like to say to our team sometimes, and speak as if the project is it could talk. Don't make it you and we and you need, you know, just say we, even though it's not our work. Let's say it's the architecture Engineers work."
Q7,715.561799,717.250701,"Interviewer: say we. We have a bad detail."
Q7,717.833555,719.921735,"Interviewer: You don't need to say you have a bad detail here, so I think"
Q7,720.417391,725.844363,"Interviewer: sort of it, always making it about what's best, which is in this case is what's best for our clients, and"
Q7,726.340019,727.964669,"Interviewer: and the product that we deliver right?"
Q7,728.53146,740.087584,"Interviewer: And then, if you do, if you use it from that standpoint like you really hit home really clearly, was, was we? I said, You said we a lot, and and I think that's the key, especially when you come into our organization and"
Q7,740.638313,751.751559,"Interviewer: and you, and with all of your experience, because you got very rich and deep experience doing what you're doing. and certainly you're a lifetime learner. You just look at your education piece and know that you have not stopped learning."
Q7,752.233447,754.110514,"Interviewer: And um so"
Q7,754.844819,757.07527,"Interviewer: I I would say um"
Q7,757.763681,763.220484,"Interviewer: in 3. I don't know how much I think we have 15Â min. I'm not sure how we're doing on time here. I think we're okay."
Q7,763.846938,766.852999,"Interviewer: But um what would be the thing?"
Q7,767.568946,774.159333,"Interviewer: Where would be the one place that you would probably dig the deepest, and or maybe it's it's touching you in a new dimension"
Q7,774.712356,780.719889,"Interviewer: that you know your resume prepares you for, but you would maybe focus more deeply on making that adaptation"
A7,782.195383,795.043424,"Veteran: for the advertised position, or just overall ok So for me, I I I would really want to kind of get a ground floor view of what's going on."
A7,795.853454,811.230259,"Veteran: because I I can probably pull the latest quarterly reports, or you know, productivity reports, and I can read those. But but to understand the story behind the stat, I would want to get out and talk with some folks and understand really what's going on, and we can find"
A7,812.634617,816.262542,"Veteran: the other thing that that allows me to do is and get out there, and and"
A7,817.106993,829.597061,"Veteran: not really interview, but kind of interview, and understand what kind of team do I have here, and who are the positional leaders, but, more importantly, who are the informal leaders that are out there that can Really."
A7,830.046822,841.045334,"Veteran: that's right. Those influencers you right, who can help form the culture that we're looking for, because so much of what it is that we're going to do in any kind of team is going to be culture driven right?"
A7,841.45838,843.762262,"Veteran: So that'd be kind of the first thing that i'd want to be able to get out and do"
Q8,844.31758,862.193316,"Interviewer: it's. It's funny you say that because we are like I said, we're 125 years old fifth generation owned, and I came to work with the fourth generation owner. We crafted our culture statement. Oh, I don't know 10 years ago, and I actually got to write it, for that was all my ideas. It was everybody's thoughts, and I just put it into a sentence and basically"
Q8,862.668319,880.85384,"Interviewer: said, we're a family of builders because we're family owned, and we are still builders. We're not brokers. We look at ourselves as true builders for a family of builders committed to the development of teams, and that was a tip to our people, because sometimes we weren't enough. We did all the technical training, but we didn't do enough soft scale training. So I wrote that to to cause us"
Q8,881.445873,886.425378,"Interviewer: to do that right, who are um to the development teams who do the right thing"
Q8,887.462584,902.157862,"Interviewer: for our projects, our clients, and each other, and that especially hard meeting. What is the right thing? Well, the right thing sometimes is what's best for client. Sometimes we take a hit. The right thing sometimes is, you know we're we're being mistreated. We gotta stand up for ourselves."
Q8,902.685643,906.862003,"Interviewer: and sometimes you guys speak about people, and or any parts of all 3 of those right."
Q8,907.566476,917.009179,"Interviewer: And and so sometimes you put that like. What you said about about culture is you? You know you put something in front of you that forces you to let those words right."
Q8,917.738894,924.939672,"Interviewer: and it sometimes. It's as simple as living those words so very well put um"
Q8,926.832802,936.488912,"Interviewer: any sort of questions of us we came in with, and i'm gonna just add lib here just a little bit, because one thing i'm I like to coach on is"
Q8,937.016694,942.652484,"Interviewer: for people to do their homework. I know in this case both of you and I are working off with a fictitious"
Q8,943.212391,944.105031,"Interviewer: job description."
Q8,944.747548,948.788519,"Interviewer: But if you were to have, if you knew the company kind of"
Q8,949.414973,967.306772,"Interviewer: what would, what would be the kinds of questions you would ask if I turn it around and say any questions about us? What would you? What would you do to prepare for that? Let's do it more about that, because we we don't know the name of this company, or what you know exactly they make. So what would you do to prepare for an interview if I turn around and said, <NAME>, what you know, what questions do you have for us?"
Q8,967.864385,969.74,"Interviewer: What are some things you would come up with."
A8,969.92,981.644076,"Veteran: So before walking in you'd want to be as prepared as you could be, so you'd certainly stock them on Google right to figure all that out. But I think the biggest questions that I would have is, what are your expectations of me?"
A8,982.736354,983.371987,"Veteran: Um"
A8,983.66,988.17939,"Veteran: What do you see are the biggest challenges?"
A8,988.810433,991.286417,"Veteran: Um in this in the area."
A8,991.749947,1000.288537,"Veteran: that for which you are considering me and the overall Company. And then, as we talked in the very beginning, what is my interaction"
A8,1000.928759,1006.431457,"Veteran: there? What is this positions interaction there um to the leadership side, because"
A8,1007.154288,1017.074289,"Veteran: it it really wouldn't matter how many skills you and I had at the level that we're at. If we don't have any equity, or any say, or any voice"
A8,1017.7191,1021.64,"Veteran: to help affect some of that change, and so trying to help feel some of that out."
Q9,1022.219013,1026.48716,"Interviewer: That's a real that's good. I I like that, because that's the thing, is research the company."
Q9,1026.874965,1042.646458,"Interviewer: and have questions about the company. I even tell some people, you know, find out how they want a certain project, or how they what was successful in engineering or delivering that project I like your point about. We call it neural selling the kind of the pains of the past. What is it you're trying?"
Q9,1042.988369,1050.12719,"Interviewer: What are some of the things that that we can do collectively that removed some of the pain in the past, or make us more efficient. Right?"
Q9,1050.595309,1060.623161,"Interviewer: Um I like that. I like the researching, because I think for me. The last thing I want to hear is, you know, and you're much more mature than this. But i'm i'm coaching"
Q9,1061.167005,1072.587742,"Interviewer: mostly coaching young Aggies and young other students getting out of college. Colorado State. I got 12 i'm working with now, when they turn that question around. I do not want to hear you say, how many weeks vacation do I get."
