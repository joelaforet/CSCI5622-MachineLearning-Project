Q1,0,27.991832,"Interviewer: Hey! Well, hi <NAME>. My name is <NAME>. I am a retired Navy cheif. I worked for the railroad for ten years. Um, I'm also at <NAME>. I've only been here a few months. We're a design build company. And then for a little while I worked for Marine-net the Marine college of distance education and AKO, so there's just my experience just so you know who you are talking to. Ha ha ha ha."
BCV,28.014481,30.808452,"Veteran: Okay, sounds good. I, I'm a little familiar with that."
Q1,31.344282,109.537189,"Interviewer: Great, great, so typically when you come into an interview situation, they'll describe their interview process and as this is a mock interview and we are just practicing, I'm going to still go with the HR manual and kind of do the stadard, uh, interview practice which is going to ask you why you want to work for our company and I understand they might have not prepared you for who we are and what we do and give you time research, so you can wing it. That's fine, we're just, we're just praticing here. Um, so I'll ask you what attracted you to this job, what attracted you to this company. Then, I'll ask you to explain your skills as per the job description. Any time you're going into an interview, you're always going to want to relate their job description to their skills. They don't want want, want your base history. They don't want your skill history. They don't want your history, they want to know you can do the job they're trying to hire for. And then, they'll uh, typically ask what your leadership style, or teamwork style is. So that will be the third part of the interview. We'll talk about why do you want to work for us, what skills do you bring to the table, what is your teamwork, and they'll typcially give you the opportunity to let you ask a question, and then there will be a wrap up where you give that elevator speech and sell it. So that's how we're kinda going to go. You good with that? "
BCV,109.805104,110.761943,"Veteran: I'm good with that."
Q1,111.221226,119.220402,"Interviewer: Alright, alright Alex. Well, tell me what attracts you to a design-build firm like Haskell?"
A1,119.909326,185.816416,"Veteran: Um, so, I've always attracted to, uh, building stuff, um, whenever I joined the military I went into enigneering, where instead of building, I learned how to demolish infrastructure. Um, so I had a lot of, a lot of leadership under me, or over me, that kind of guided me towards civil engineering where I'm at now, here at Texas A&M, and uh, I just, I just, you know, kind of fell in love with it, fell in love wiht civil engineering and uh, that's what I'm going for toward my degree in, and so I really do enjoy um, seeing you know, the design process is starting from scratch, starting from surveying, you know, and then going up to the actual design of a building. And you know, you can definitely see the process go, and uh, that's uh, kind of what I see from Haskell. It's more hands on, it's not jsut sitting around the office all day. I want to be outside, I want to be, I want to see the project grow. And at Haskell, I feel like that's something I feel like you guys can deliver for me."
Q2,186.275699,210.426323,"Interviewer: That's excellent, now just for your own knowledge, Haskell does have a federal devision. We just, uh, we are breaking ground on the new twenty-nine palms, um, PX, and you will, working here, spend time in the office, on site, and in the client's location. So, tell me a little bit more about your skills, or how your education will prepare you for this job.  "
A2,211.115247,337.903453,"Veteran: Um, so, some of the skills that I know you guys are kind of focused on is autocad. Um, I have been very proficient in, uh, Civil 3D, um, in my resume, you see that I have a Google site where you can see some of my, um projects that I've worked on. I'm actually in the process of working on one of the professors, who asked me by name and, and, I'm just working with him on Civil 3D designing and annotating notes. Going outside and collecting survey data which is also another skillset that I have I feel like separates me apart from just another civil engineer is I have the availilty to go out, collect survey data, and actually build from that. So, not only am I working in the office, but I'm also working on-site and you know, just seeing what I want to build and, you know what's there. And, uh, I also have, I'm doing research with Texas University Infoworks - AutoCAD Infoworks. Working with 3D design, and uh, road design as well, so uh, I feel like that's another skillset I can bring to Haskell. And uh, just other than that, just like, just basic common skills, I'm able to do cross, uh, crossfunction leadership and uh, transist very work. I'm able to work with the HR department, I'm able to work with communications. Anyone I need to as long as, you know, it's within the scope of our project. I can deliever, um, just general knowledge as a civil engineer, so I know that's kind of hard for a lot of people. I know like, you know, like, you know, they'll ask you ""What do you do?"" Okay, and I'm like ""Oh, I'm a civil engineer"" and I have to explain my projects to them. Uh, and I kind of have to put them in terms where it's more um understandable for people because as a civil engineer, we say a lot of things, and have a lot of acronyms, just like in the military, and uh, you kind of have to simplify some stuff for other people, or word it in a different way, and that kind of in my opinion, the best skill that I have, is communication. I'm really able to relate to anybody and bring factors to the table that elevate any project. "
Q3,338.527966,359.578431,"Interviewer: That's excellent, and you're right; sometimes I would leave my office when they, when they were doing the military roads lessons and I'd have to say ""hold on, I speak engineer, I'll be right there"", ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Combat engineers, worked with a lot of them. So, ha ha ha. So this is excellent, um, have you used Blue Beam at all?"
BCV,360.267355,362.372401,"Veteran: No, I have not."
Q3,362.563769,401.679359,"Interviewer: Okay, that's an up and coming technology, that a lot of design-build firms are using. Also, if you look at something called Disrupt-Tech Online, you'll notice that autoCAD is getting used a lot in something called Project Hero, which uses, um, sights, uses AutoCAD to do site safety. So, before you actually show up at a location, you'll actually have to have taken a safety lesson based on that actual location using the AutoCAD drawings. So that's something that I think that you might find yourself interested in if youi look at the Haskell website. So, tell me a little bit more about how you work in teams and what your leadership style is?"
A3,402.023821,527.293221,"Veteran: Um, so, working with a team, I, my leadership style is more of cross-peer-to-peer versus the top-down approach. I, I'm actually working on a project right now with a group fo students from different colleges called the Aggie Legacy Project, where we're um, trying to develop a method of collecting and maintaining and kind of just preserving the history of Aggie Veterans, um, through AI, through, 3D modeling, and through uh, historical biographies, so you know it's, it's kind of we're using the team science approach where everyone had a little bit of part of each other's tasks. Um, obviously, we maintain our own tasks, but if we need help, or if we need a little more extra push, um, you know, someone from, uh, different part of the project will come by and help out. And, uh, I, we're also working on Agile developments where we bring out a rapid prototype, test it out, you know, see what works, what doesn't work. And uh, just, just like I said, where it's not a top down, it's more just peer-to-peer leadership style, um, we're, we're actually able to communicate a lot more effectively versus where we have to wait and get confirmation, my leadership style is more kind of like delegating, um, just kind of like talking with the group and, you know, I propose and idea, and, you know, they just give me some feedback on it, and, you know, we kind of build togther off of that, and, you know we come up with a better product than was. We have to wait for someone to come and tell us ""yes"". We do have a supervisor and uh, he actually likes this idea of team science and Agile development, versus, us just haveing to go to him every single time we have a new idea, you know, we per, we, we, uh, come up with a solution, and we propose a solution to him and, you know, that's when he gets, he pushes that up to the VA, who is actaully the person that is contracting us, and then they kind of give us the thumbs up, thumbs down on that."
IRR,528.364881,569.011414,"Interviewer: No, I like that, keep those SCRUMs going, they, ha ha, how else are we going to get there? Excellent, excellent, so, um, Haskell was a, I want to say founded, I'm going to say founded's a good word, Haskell was founded by Preston Haskkell, who was one of the original design-build, um, engineers, so he kind of brought that methodology here to North Florida, he isn't um, he isn't uh, credited with the design build theory, but he was on the first people that did that. So, um, just understanding who we are as a company, what questions do you have for me about whether Haskell is a good fit for Alexs?"
IRR,569.432423,578.503259,"Veteran: Um, defininitely my only questions would be utilization rate as a starting, um, imp, uh, entry level position?"
IRR,578.732901,583.861559,"Interviewer: Here's your boots, here's your laptop, get out in the field, get out to the job, the client is waiting on you. Day one."
IRR,583.861559,584.818399,"Veteran: Sounds, sounds good to me."
IRR,584.818399,588.875397,"Interviewer: Ha ha ha. I'm not kidding. Ha ha ha."
IRR,588.875397,600.05128,"Veteran: Like, like, that's what I definitely want with a company is like, I, I don't want to be, you know, getting coffee, or a latte for someone, you know, I want to be out there learning and uh, and doing stuff"
IRR,600.510563,611.039255,"Interviewer: I have an intern who is right now working as the uh, assistant superintendant. He's an intern. Ha ha ha. He's a thrid year intern, but we trust him, but, ha ha ha."
IRR,611.064881,611.641454,"Veteran: Okay."
IRR,611.722601,613.157627,"Interviewer: Haha"
IRR,613.332209,628.037481,"Interviewer: But, this is that type of company where your first day you'll be handed your employee manual, your laptop, do these boots fit? Here's your safety gear, you have a plane ticket for tomorrow, go to work. Ha ha ha ha."
IRR,628.067534,631.550429,"Veteran: Yeah, that definitely sounds like something I would be very interested in."
Q4,632.239354,661.518636,"Interviewer: Excellent, excellent, so the last part of this interview process that I mentioned was your elevator pitch, so you get to the end of the interview, you've given great answers to their questions, you've descreibed your skills based on their job description, and you have felt through your questions that this is the rightr company for you. So, what is that last pitch that Alex is going to leave the interviewers with so that they, they know that he's the person for them?"
A4,662.475475,680.081318,"Veteran: Um, you know, thank you for your time, thank you for the opportunity to have this interview with you. Um, hopefully, from my resume and from what we talked through today, you can see that I am a, uh, applicable person, I'm a great fit for your company and I""m ready and excited to start working for you guys."
IRR,680.617148,726.660254,"Interviewer: That is a great wrap up, I also want you to bring in that you have military experience and education. And militay experience combined with education make you a better cadidate becuase you, you know, one, you've proven that you have the muscle to get the job done, now you have the brains, so good on you for that. Well, I know that you're going to do well, I can aleady tell well, I have already interviewed over one-hundred fifty people from my management training candidates and I have very well placed candidated throughout the railroad, and um, the military cadidates that I work with, so I apprecite your time today. Um, Alex, I'm on LinkedIn if you need help in your studies, or you actually do become interested in Haskell, just let me know. "
IRR,727.081264,729.415951,"Veteran: Okay, I will definietly let you know."
IRR,729.951781,731.945674,"Interviewer: Sounds great, have yourself a great day"
