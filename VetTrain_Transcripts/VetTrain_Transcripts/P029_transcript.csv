A3,447.1,462.85,"Veteran: And then, of course, talking to the local civilians who you know local civilians who are not members of the military completely changed scripts on them because we didn't really necessarily want them to know why we're asking the question we were asking."
A3,463.440527,463.975746,"Veteran: Um."

A4,604.63,618.79,"Veteran: I would say, this is what we have to get done and i'm completely open to ideas of how to do it because you guys usually have better, faster, more efficient ways of thinking than I do, so I just learned to tap into."

Q5,667,681.49,"Interviewer: And so, as far as you know, on the flip side from leading can you describe a time or think of a time where you changed your approach based on feedback that you received."

A5,699.01,708.76,"Veteran: Speaking or presenting or you know briefing people pretty pretty bad and I would get pretty nervous, so I had leadership say, you know let's practice let's."
A5,709.09,720.94,"Veteran: go over this go over it again keep doing that, until you're more comfortable and that that was just advice and I have people helped me through that and that made a world of difference, and I also had a."
A5,722.65,731.86,"Veteran: People leaders tell me, I would get really emotional over things like physically I get upset and i'd show my emotions and."
A5,732.73,749.41,"Veteran: Very occasionally under the right circumstances that might not be a bad thing, but most of the time it's better just to keep your cool and I really I basically worked on that just kind of worked on personal ways to calm myself down and not and not get so emotional or raise my voice or."
A5,750.353271,761.8,"Veteran: Or show you a physical soundness or anything and that has helped me a lot as well so i've tried to take advice I people just try to constructively give you."
A5,762.82,768.13,"Veteran: and improve the way I I work at work and with other people."
A5,770.68,778.57,"Veteran: kind of like a technical technical experience and then a personal it's really kind of technical improvement and personal improvement."
Q6,782.98,795.25,"Interviewer: Great yeah I mean feedback comes in all different forms um well great, I only have one more like formal question for you so obviously having worked in the environments that you've worked."
Q6,795.82,803.23,"Interviewer: I would imagine in a lab setting as well as a military setting you know, there is a hierarchy there's certain protocols and procedures to be followed."
Q6,803.62,819.34,"Interviewer: Can you think of a time and tell me about a time when you disagreed with someone more senior and you had to kind of let them know you know that difference of opinion and and what kind of solution you offered to to help with that difference of opinion."
A6,821.59,822.97,"Veteran: Sure um, I."
A6,824.2,840.22,"Veteran: maybe not necessarily didn't disagree with a verbal instruction that was given to me, but in my job at the vitamin company it's kind of a tedious thing to describe but we had to test the kind of the."
A6,841.45,851.53,"Veteran: particle size of these vitamin powders that we need, so they can't be too fine or too course in order to be made into pills and gummies and capsules."
A6,852.55,862.93,"Veteran: And there was one set of sifters that gave me one result and another set of for one for one vitamin powder and another type of."
A6,863.5,870.91,"Veteran: sifter that were almost the same they gave me a completely different result and one result passed our test and one result did not pass our test."
A6,871.51,886.21,"Veteran: And, and I could mostly the problem was the the original weights of the sifters were off so that threw off the results on our excel spreadsheet that we typed the weights of everything into so I."
A6,888.1,893.53,"Veteran: And it caused me to have to do a lot of extra paperwork, so I actually I."
A6,895.45,909.82,"Veteran: I weighed them on the not correct pans and reported those results, but then I realized I you know, I have to fix I can't just do that, I have to fix it, so I went to my supervisor, and said this isn't working I can I, what can I do to."
A6,911.14,919.45,"Veteran: fix these spreadsheets and these pan weights, so this is more likely to wait, you know if if it's not going to pass it's not going to pass, but it's."
A6,919.99,931.27,"Veteran: I want it to be accurate and so he said you can reweigh all the pans 25 times throughout the course of you know, the days that you're using them and and we do make the."
A6,932.74,945.07,"Veteran: We can remake the averages on the spreadsheet and that took a lot of extra time for me actually i'm going to reweigh them because you have to clean them out every time but I thought that was worth it and the right way to do it, so I kind of disagreed with."
A6,946.48,954.34,"Veteran: That is just the status quo and I did bring it to the attention in a short short period of time after considering the easier way out to then."
A6,955.09,968.151941,"Veteran: That was a we ended up we reweighed everything we got everything straightened out and the correct weights entered in and then it was a lot easier to get the particle size of the vitamin pattern after that."
Q7,971.756797,991.81,"Interviewer: Ok great well, I guess that's the last really you know formal question and then just you know, finally, obviously you've had a wealth of experience and you're kind of looking to make a move, where do you see yourself in the next five years, and how do you envision yourself accomplishing that."

A7,1008.67,1009.18,"Veteran: um."
A7,1010.2,1025.35,"Veteran: Because, because I believe all the you know everything that has to do with our agriculture and food and water and eating and everything that we eat has a lot to do with human health, so I would like to stay in that field."

A7,1059.85,1066.215061,"Veteran: It was a job listing that I was applying for and this is just it's hard for me to make up stuff."
A7,1066.78,1071.22,"Veteran: That was the honest answer of what I see myself in five years."
